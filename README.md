A store for my text files.

TODO Files Syntax:
  + Each line contains a task
  + Preceeding each line is a [set] of tag(s), delimited by colons
  + Double colons are used to delimit the set of tags and the actual task.


File "notes" contains different things I learn as I go on.  

File "web" is for bookmarks. also uses tags.
