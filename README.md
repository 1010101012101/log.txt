# log.txt

Personal Note: **Remember to** ***gitignore*** **files containing sensitive info!**  

keep track of my text files  

TODO Files Syntax:
  + Each line contains a task
  + Preceeding each line is a [set] of tag(s), delimited by colons
  + After the last tag are two colons  


File "notes" contains different things I learn as I go on.  


File "web" is for bookmarks. also uses tags.
