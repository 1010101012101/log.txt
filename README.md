# log.txt

This is a store for my text files.  


**Note to _Self_** : **Remember** to gitignore files containing sensitive info**!**  


  
  
TODO Files' Syntax:
  + Each line contains a task
  + Preceeding each line is a [set] of tag(s), delimited by colons
  + Double colons are used to delimit the set of tags and the actual task.  


File "notes" contains different things I learn as I go on.  

File "web" is for bookmarks. also uses tags.
