SMERP - Cloud-based solution

Software for business accounting

Records such as: Product, Marketing, Shipping, Inventory, Payments

It provides one integrated system for all departments
It is cost efficient - E.g. no extra server costs, less expenses on resources
There is improved flow of communication
Little or no data replication

Easily implemented
SMERP is a modular application; so you get what suits/is-needed-by your particular business
It is web-based, so it is cross-platform
