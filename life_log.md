#01.01.2016

The year 2016 kicked off on a rather normal note. Last night, a few hours before 12AM, we (me and my aunt's family) were at the church. Church service lasted till just after new year -- about 12.20AM


We got home and I broke my day-long food break (no pun intended). I had some malt (Amstel Malta) -- I didn't get one to buy at the time we left church. I would later refuse to take any of the fizzy drinks offered during lunch because of this; plus I felt (for sentimental reasons) that my aunt might not have been pleased I took one of the malt drinks (there were four cans, and I had one of them) in the refrigerator -- and milk (Hollandia Milk, sold for 130 naira). We had prayers, and then it was the next meal round for me. I had some _garri_ and chicken, which of course, my aunt handed me.

<br />

This morning, getting up at about 6AM, we kick started the day. We were to attend church is the practice at my aunt's church. I have partaken in that, the last two years. So I went on to wash the two cars -- my aunts' and her husbands'. We left the house after 9 O'Clock, and when we arrived at the church, it was already 10AM.

This first-day-of-the-year program is usually geared towards the announcement of a new __anchor__ -- something we chant in faith, at the end of every church service, all year round. Amongst other things, the anchor's declaration is usually preceded by about three prophecies. And so it was today. The announcement came in the third: __"O God: Thou art my HELP, and my DELIVERER"__; a declaration drawn out of Psalm 70 vs 5.

With the rest of the family, I left the church after 4PM, after having stayed in traffic for about an hour. We had left Folabi and Dapo -- two of my cousins -- at the church. They would much later, much to their surprise, find their way home themselves.

<br />

At home, I got a call from my pastor -- Pastor Odusina -- to check up on his phone, and help fix an issue. Alas, the issue was that his newly installed Skype app wasn't connecting to the internet, and was displaying an "offline" status. When, I got there, it just worked without me touching it.

Next was his wife.

I recently helped purchase a new smartphone for my pastor's wife, and offered to help diagnose her laggy old phone.

These were the activities that took up most of my evening, even until just before now (current system time: 21.54) that I'm writing this.

<br />

I am hoping to hack some code tonight, but there is no power supply at the moment; this battery'll only last a while.

As part of my plans for 2016, I hope to read a paper a day as a way to become ever more read and deepen my insight in my autodidactic journey. I haven't read any today, but I found some [very awesome resource on Github](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love), a curation of computer science based academic papers.

I am crowdsourcing for paper suggestions. I welcome you to contribute your to-read paper/essay suggestions in the comments. I also have [this question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-recommended-list-of-essays-papers-to-read-one-per-day-in-2016-for-an-autodidact-who-wants-to-widen-his-horizon-but-focus-on-Soft-Engr?share=1) where you may also post your answers.

Speaking of Quora, I found [this really interesting profile](https://www.quora.com/profile/Obinna-Okechukwu) on Quora minutes after returning from the new year cross-over church service. He has a [Quora-hosted blog](https://tcsnotes.quora.com/), where he reviews or puts details of Computer Science papers.

And there was [this other guy](https://www.quora.com/profile/James-L-Moyer?share=1) -- creator of [AutodidactLife](http://www.TheAutodidactLife.com) -- who encouraged me to read transcripts of TED talks. His answers on Quora show that he has some insightful knowledge on autodidactism.

<br />

More personally, I didn't speak with my mum today -- something I find rather strange for the first day of the year, but I did call my grandma and sister. My sister, Tobi, is with a cousin (Aunt Ladun) for the new year.

#02.01.2015

On the night of January 1, the previous night, while writing for _[Life Log](/category/life-log.html)_, I laid on the dinning chairs hoping to wake as soon as power was restored. For whatever reasons, it wasn't until one of my alarms went off at __5.15AM__ that I got up to realize that the power had long been supplied. At the time, my cousin, Deji was watching Sky Sports in the parlour area of the living room.

On waking up I read the bible. This is something I have not been doing consistently, however, this time, I don't intend to rush through this; so I'm taking it very slow and hopefully steady. I read thirteen verses: __Genesis 1.1-13__. These verses describe the __first three days of Creation__.

Later, I reminded myself of my plan to begin reading academic papers today.

My aunt and the rest of the family, on waking up, joined us in the living room, and we said our morning prayers.

Being a Saturday, it was only natural that we would do some sanitation. And so that followed. I did spend 'extra' amount of time cleaning and reassembling my small makeshift wardrobe (testament to my obsessions with cleaning).

<br />

At noon, I had my meal, and went on to spend some time on IRC while doing some other regular things I would do usually do on my computer: sort files, check code and repos on [Github](http://github.com), read code, surf the web sourcing more and more general knowledge.

While I was on IRC, **_empdokles_** (an IRC buddy) asked if we could work together on an application messaging extension for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). I think it's a great idea that would also require quite a bit of a learning curve. For instance, neither of us is good with Javascript, but our intended application would definitely need it, so we'd need to learn that.

In the evening, I was able to fix a small bug with my blog that was caused by conflicting options.

<br />

With regards to time and upcoming events, I under pressure to contribute code to my team's projects, particularly **project _jobnownow_**, which is the one we intend to get out as soon as possible. I am only trying to be calm and organized, as when the year's activities are fully resumed, _time would become a wilder horse to tame_, something, obvious though it seems, I thank my mother for pointing my blinded attention to. 

I know I still have quite a lot of things lined up. Some might be done, and some I may have to let go. Among them, four projects for my team -- one is a hospital information management system application for a client. I also have a pending Java certification examination, the OCAJP 1Z0-803 examination, which was again postponed until mid-January 2016.

Then, I have entreprenuerial and Python meetups which I signed up for last year. I also have my eyes -- but not my mind -- on the [BBC Africa's ideas workshop](http://cchubnigeria.com/blog/) scheduled for later this month at CcHub, Yaba. And very recently, a co-developer acquaintance at NIIT informed me of Facebook's [app innovation challenge](https://www.internet.org/innovationchallenge) via [Internet.org](http://internet.org) for Africa.

There's also the [DjangoGirls web development workshop](https://djangogirls.org/lagos/) coming up. I signed up for this as a mentor last December after learning about the event via the Python-Nigeria mailing list. This one won't hold until February 2016 though.

<br />

Outside these events, I have plans to code my own IRC bot. So I'm making efforts towards that as well. At the moment, I am trying to write unit tests for an open source bot, [_ekan0ra_ (aka _batul_)](http://github.com/takwas/theb0t). I also started working on my own bot last year: [sawkat](http://github.com/takwas/sawkat). I have begun learning about the [`twisted`](https://github.com/twisted/twisted) Python library which is used for coding IRC clients and bots.

<br />

On a different note, I delayed my new year greetings messages until about 10PM. And that's when I unleashed them to their respective recipients. I'm sure the reponses would be flooding in by morning.

<br />

Past 12AM, I got to reading the introductory part of **_Roy Fielding's_** well known dissertation on software architecting, particulary because it is also widely recommended to anyone looking to fully comprehend and build [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Prior to this, I had no idea what the typical size of an academic dissertation was; I had projected something under 20 pages.

To my disappointment, I opened Roy's work to behold a close-to-200-page work. As a result of this, I have now rethought my paper reading plan. I will no longer try to complete one paper per day. Instead, I'll spread these papers across days and try to read them through. So help me God.

#03.01.2015

I didn't read the bible this morning, but the family had a morning devotion as usual. My sleep was a rather short one, spanning about three hours.

After the devotion, I got ready for church service. I got to the church at exactly 9AM.

I wasn't called up to interpret during the service, in fact, no youth was. The interpretion was done by one of the elders, Elder Ogunkomaya. I would think this had to do with the service being the first Sunday service for the year.

Being the first Sunday of the year, one would expect some sort of thanksgiving service. That it was, but only slightly. I guess the full package isn't until the first Sunday in February.

There were two prophecies, and one of them mentioned that, the service need not be rushed. This is worthy of note because, prior to both prophecies, the pastor had asked the prophets to keep their prophecies short.

The sermon was tagged "Unselfish Desires ...". While I particularly liked this topic, I wasn't very pleased with some of the prayer points that followed. In my opinion, they seemed rather contradictory to the theme of the sermon.

<br />

In the afternoon, I had a much needed siesta -- something I'm very grateful for. I slept off while listening to a [third TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?language=en) of the afternoon. I really enjoyed [one of the talks](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en)<sup>__[1]__</sup>, that talked about "choice". I found the talk interesting because I could easily agree with the speaker's postulations. During his presentation, the speaker, Barry Schwartz said,

<br/>
> "The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."

<br/>

I was woken from my sleep afterwards by my pastor's son, Tosin. He had been sent to fetch me. My pastor's wife and children had to travel the following morning, so needed some gas in their car for the trip. For this I drove out to get some petrol.

However, just before I could drive out, an incidence caused some delay. His son had carelessly locked the car key in the vehicle; alas, there were no spare keys. So this became the hurdle we had to face for the next 30-45 minutes. What's more: he had ignited the vehicle just before locking it in, so the car was running the whole time.

Eventually, with the help of a few folks -- good thing to be a _good pastor_; lots of folks came around to help very quickly -- we got a metal bar into the door and removed the lock.

Over two hours later, I got the fuel, but not while I drove around searching. I had returned in disappointment and parked the car. In our little gas-haunting adventure, we had failed to obtain that which we sought for owing to general scarcity. In fact, on three occasions, we were told that the fuel in the station's supply was exhausted when it was only a couple of cars to our turn.

In eventual frustration, I managed to get the car back home with the little fuel left in it. Afterwards, I left with my gallon in a commercial tricycle headed in a different direction as the one I had previously traveled in. Surprisingly, I met a newly opened petrol station only a minute or two into the journey. They were eagerly distributing the scarce commodity to their new customers; I too joined the party.

<br />

On a different note, my sister returned home from my cousins' a few minutes before I got back home. She came back with a diary and calender for me, which I very much appreciate. What I need to complete that set is a wrist-watch in a bid to be well organised in 2016.

#04.01.2015

I _first_ woke up at exactly 2AM. I think two things I did yesterday made it easy for me to wake up that early: one, I had siesta; and two, I didn't eat dinner. I have noticed you gain more control over your night time sleep when you fail to eat supper. If you must eat however, I would reckon you go with something extremely light; even a beverage should suffice.

Upon waking up, I checked Facebook, and was thrill-inspired by the status that appeared at the very top. It was by the creator of Facebook himself, Mark Zuckerberg. How inspiring it is to learn that someone of that calibre still gave himself a book reading challenge -- he did so last year -- and on top of that, gave himself a new goal of building an AI for the new year -- he specifically said he'll do the coding himself, not instruct a technical team to do that.

<br/>
> "But it's a different kind of rewarding to build things yourself, so this year my personal challenge is to do that."

<br/>

I spent the next few hours cleaning up some not-yet-published scribbles and blog posts. I tried to code, but ended up just doing a little bit of reading, then returning to sleep at about 5AM.

<br />

Waking up again at about 7AM. I grabbed my breakfast pretty early, and then set off to do some much overdue laundry. That plus some other other cleaning chores took some hours.

Afterwards, I spent the rest of the day at my aunt's shop.

There, I spent some time learning about [how to test code in Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/). I learnt about __[unit testing](http://pythontesting.net/framework/unittest/unittest-introduction/)__ and __[doc testing](http://pythontesting.net/framework/doctest-introduction/#example)__, the latter being the easier one in my opinion. I also peeked into the __[twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/index.html)__ networking library which I'll need for coding my IRC bot.

Later on, I learned that it's good practice to keep "running code" (script) separate from algorithm code and data-handling code.

#05.01.2015

I woke up at 5.30AM after failing to properly wake at 2AM, ignoring my alarm earlier. Because of my intention to wake at 2AM, I had refused taking dinner yesterday, and asked that it be reserved until this morning. I guess I just couldn't help the sleepiness.


When I visited IRC yesterday, I enquired about "hacks for reading". The answer I got was a link to a [webpage](http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/speed1.html). Visiting that page today, I found these awesome speed reading tips: 

+ Pre-scan the material, before actually reading thouroughly. Get an overview of the main points/headings/subheadings beforehand.
+ Read with intent. Once you have a grasp of the main ideas, you can read with an inquisitive mindset. Question the main points, and read as if you are searching for answers.
+ Kill the voice in your head ... and mouth! Avoid vocalization and sub-vocalization; let your brain do the work.
+ Read in word clusters (phrases), rather than word after word. This needs some getting used to, as I've seen.
+ Avoid re-reading the same phrases again. Reading should be forward ever, and almost backward never.
+ Understand that every material may not be read with the same speed. E.g newspapers can be read pretty fast, whereas technical stuff may not be read so fast, but in detail.



I also found some hair-combing tips:

+ Mosturize the hair (dampen it with water) before combing
+ Apply a generous amount of oil (Olive oil in my case)
+ Comb gently (backwards or forwards), starting from the ends, and repeating until the roots (scalp)

I spent some time on the road today going from where I live in Bariga, to Ajah, both in Lagos State. I managed to catch some sleep on the road, and also do some reading -- I read a portion of a book I'm currently reading -- __["The Lovely Bones"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12232938-the-lovely-bones)__.

I attended a vigil at the church tonight.

#06.01.2015

I attended church service early this morning just before returning home from the vigil I attended last night.

<br />

My sister returned to school today. I had accompanied my aunt to drop her off at the park. On our way back from there, I alighted from the vehicle to pay a quick visit to the market, where I bought a few things before returning home.

<br />

I was pondering on the notions of _bliss_ and _nothingness_ today. The concept of "nothingness" was inspired by a "TEDcast"  -- that's _TED_ + _podcast_ :).

I feel I don't attain bliss because of my usual mood combinations: I'm usually either __excited/jovial and loud__ or __angry and extremely quiet/taciturn__. But what I desire as the perfect combo for me is __joy and quietude__.

How I wish I'd be so happy and quietly, gracefully appreciate the _art_ of life.

<br />

Another thought that came up today was that of my outward personality. I grew up thinking _my own_ didn't appreciate me. That the strangers (some of whom have become friends) I was introduced to were the ones who loved me.

Now I realise that I am only clothed when I go out, and people simply adore my neat appearance. Back at my source called home, I am fully naked and the attitude I put up is the real me -- no makeup attached.

So if the people here (at home) have been able to put up with me until now, then I feel I should show some appreciation.


I also thought of curating a list of some must-learn Python modules.

Meanwhile, I've been trying to get acquainted with _testing_ and program _packaging_ in Python. So I have been putting some time into learning these.

#07.01.2015

Today is the seventh day of the year. That makes it one week already in the new. And I'm already failing at one of my goals -- reading academic papers.

Well, I also failed to do some logging today. So please move along.











#__ __


#08.01.2015


I had some sleep in the afternoon while the [vulcanizer]() attended to my aunt's car.

Later, I drove the car to the store and would remain there until evening.

I ended the day attending a vigil at the church. This one was at the headquarter church.

Not much logging today as well. Kindly proceed to the next one.








#__ __


#09.01.2015

Owing to last night's vigil, my sleep stretched into the morning. At the time, the clock had ticked past 9AM, but _thank God it's Saturday_. I was awoken by a call from someone with whom I had exchanged phone numbers earlier. He was my prayer partner at the vigil.

I quickly grabbed some breakfast, and went about doing a few house chores. I had spent quite some time on this as usual. When I finished, I headed for my aunt's store where I would spend the rest of my day.

At the store, I read a bit of "The Lovely bones". Within the little time there was power supply there, I did some IRC-ing with my computer. This was the same time that would be sufficient for my cousin's laptop charger to burn.

Even though the supplied electricity was clearly bad, I had taken the same risk as my cousin did, but was merely fortunate enough to have an unscathed computer system.

For the rest of the day I was occupied with activities at the store helping with one or two car deliveries.







#__ __


#10.01.2015

Church service today was a rather lengthy one, being the first combined service of the year in the district I belong to.


For me, the day started at about 5AM when I tried to get some quick fixes across on the [dgplug's bot project]() I'm [contributing]() to. Fortunately for me today, I successfully [got the bot to run from the Heroku servers](), something I've been stuck with for about two days -- of course with so much non-hacking time in between.

I got that running, tried to put a few enhancements on the bot, which failed, and then sped off to church to arrive at just about a minute late. So I did not observe any personal bible study today.


At the church, I was privileged to be called up to handle the interpretation for the first service of the day. As always, this was a fun experience. I do this quiet this confidently, and I find it's kind of a way to practice public speaking albeit _echoing_ someone else's speech in this case.

The service went on for long, and eventually ended at about 4 PM.

At home, I was in the mood for some Christian Rap. I played a few songs, but then it dawned on me to play the songs while reading their lyrics. I think you need to read the lyrics at times to get the full message of a Christian Rap song, especially when it isn't so it easy to follow along.

I went to the Google Play Store, did a search for "lyrics app" and landed with this: [MusicMatch](). It was the perfect app. I also found [Genius]() but I prefer MusicMatch.

I am hoping to return to Ajah tomorrow and kick start the new year on an official note: school, freelancing, and contributing code to my team's projects.

#11.01.2015



Having stayed up all night and attending an early morning (6AM) church service, my sleep began at about 7.30AM and lasted till about 10.30AM

I woke up to be greeted by the unpleasant consequence of something some event that occured last night. I had accidentally spilled water on my cousin's laptop. And now he's keyboard malfunctions, some keys have stopped working.

This might have been curtailed if I had been early-aware of the spill on my cousin's computer, because it only became apparent some minutes after cleaning the portion of the liquid that had also spilled on my laptop.

I did some google search on the next step. The options were:

+ loose the computer and clean the keyboard
+ replace the keyboard

I thought of calling a friend, which I did, but his call was answered by someone who had picked his phone from where he lost it. So I settled for cleaning the computer, but that wasn't going to be until later after my cousin had returned from purchasing a replacemnt for his charger which got fried (not literaly) two days ago.


Later, I got to my computer and began to find a fix for a bug I encountered while trying to setup testing for the IRC bot project I am contributing to. The script to run the tests had persistently failed to run.

In the end, an angel in the form of user Wooble bailed me out of my misery with this statement:

> "an important thing to note is that you can't sensibly run a script from inside a package. If that's what you're doing, stop."


My aunt had come in now; she had taken ill. So I went to her store to help out with a few things. This was when I again, accidentally fell some crates and got about 15 mostly non-empty bottles broken.

I spent the rest of the day not thinking about any of these mess; they would only spoil my day.

I spent the rest of the day at the store. This meant I wasn't returning to Ajah immediately, at least not until my aunt had recovered.










#__ __


#12.01.2015

Last night I had slept off trying to fix my cousin's broken keyboard. I had dismantled the box, but couldn't proceed without a cleaning solvent and some cotton wool.

Waking up this morning, just before I resumed work on it, we had morning prayers in which I alongside another folk in the house, Paul was asked to say the prayers following the bible reading.

So I got to cleaning the kehyboard when my cousin presented me with the needed materials. Last night I had watched a [video]() detailing the procedures, but I wasn't willing to go through that long process, choosing rather to go with some on-the-surface cleaning.

Eventually, the affected keys didn't work, so I'm given them a few days to see if they'll come around, after which I might go with my other option: go get a replacement.

Later on, I got to some work with my bot and started trying to do some refactoring.

While testing the bot on IRC, it started being lousy, openly responding to my commands and that raised a few eyebrows. Folks advised me to take my bot off the channel (no pun intended). I asked why this rule wasn't stated in the channel topic (I was in the #python channel) that bots weren't allowed, and I was told it was because bots have tendencies to respond to people in annoying ways. So I gave one of my reasons for creating a bot, which I believe is a good enough reason. That prompted folks to recommend IRC bouncers.

That was a good one, because as it turns out, IRC bouncers achieve what I want, which is to maintain a log of channel discussions in case I get disconnected intermittently while in the middle of getting/offering help for instance. This [video]() explained it to me.

Afterwards, I got some sleep. I woke when power supply was restored to do just a little more coding. I went on to wash my aunt's car, a chore I had delayed since morning.

While washing, I was opportune to have some kids around. They came fetching water in turns from the same source as I. I 

Later an incidence made me to wander what creates fear in a person. A kid had seen my image disappear into a dark stairway. I looked back at him from there, and saw he became really frightened. It was a very funny scene. But I went on pondering on the concept of fair ""

Later I visited her store. I didn't do much, as she closed rather early for the day.

On returning home, I resumed work on my conputer, and went to bed later on -- there was no power supply and my laptop had little power on it.


I was 
Thinking about the kids at the tap.

Thinking about what teaches kids to fear; I had an exp with Korede at the staircase this evening.

Prayed in the morning. Prayed tonight. How to stop self-centered prayers? Compare prayer in Psalms with Jesus' taught one.


I learnt about IRC bouncers BNC and ZNC, being the sort of tools I need retrieve channel messages upon disconnect.

#13.01.2015

I failed to wake up in the middle of the night, only getting up to turn of the electric  buld from its socket.

My Java certification exam is hopefully tomorrow. I have to return to Ajah today.









#__ __


#14.01.2015

I was up until about 4AM this morning after which I got some sleep, before waking up again at about 7AM.

In the time that I spent hacking around this morning, I went from posting a couple of <sup>questions[1]</sup> on Quora to writing some documentation for the bot project. I also added a few snippets of code to the project.

During the day I reconnected with friends et al at school, and especially with my team members.

With my team, we got talking on several things, but a major point is that we need to iterate fast and deploy at least one of our apps.

I spent some time trying to get Seyi (our new
I had issues trying to get my Flask-based app to run from Heroku. That issue is still not solved.

One interesting thing that happened at the time was a message I received from a fellow memeber of the Quora communit, someone with whom I have recently developed mpre interaction, and would consider a mwntor at least when it comes to rreading and writing: Catherine Oates.

She offered me the opportunity to contribute to her project. More on that in subsequent posts.

This morning resumed at NIIT for the yearl.










#__ __


#15.01.2015

I slept through the night, thinking I would wake at night to study for my Java certification exams which I had thought I would be sitting today after failing to do so yesterday.

I got to NIIT today and started going over Python code instead of studying. It just goes to show that working on my project means a lot.

Evenually, I spent the whole day working on my bot, in that small room where Java classes often hold.

I wrote docstrings (documentation comments) for functions, methods, classes and modues/files/packages. I also refactored the code to be more [PEP-8]() compliant.

On IRC, thanks to _rweir_, I learnt about a tool called flake8. This tool scans your code and alerts for any non-standard coding styles found.

I also learnt a lot from my newly discovered trove of _ropes_, __site-packages__. I did some comparison between my code and the packages I found there, and consequently made changes to my code.

At the end of the day, I had walked with one of the staff at school, Mr Jeffery Osagie. I recall during our walk talk he did mention something about "having resources and skills", which he had learned from a book.


When I checked Facebook today, I got a message request. Upon accepting the request, I was surprised by the message that rolled in. It was from an old school mate. Anieka Bassey, the lady who sent me the message seemed so confident about knowing me, meanwhile I can hardly place her face.

That not withstanding, I am glad to connect with her. And she seemed like a real fun person. At least I did my 'due dilligence' -- stalking her on Facebook.







#__ __


#16.01.2015
The vigil from last night ended at about 3.30AM this morning.

While waiting for Mr Samuel to round off with meetings in church and take us home, I quickly got on Quora to do some early morning reads. One of the questions I looked at was this:
Why do so many beginner programmers think they should build everything from scratch?

An interesting answer by Marcas Neal had this in it:
"Without the experience of doing it the hard way as a beginner, then using frameworks later on, you can't make the leap to a senior developer position!"

I mean, that is such a sensible thing to say. I remember once answering on Quora, and saying that a master is not a master only because of his successes, but also because he knows how to fail. []()

We got back home at about 5AM, and we all got some sleep. On waking up at 9AM, I did some cleaning, and got out a little later. I visited my friends (members of my team) at our usual meetup -- Deji's office.

We had all agreed to come play Deji's newly purchased PlayStation4 (God knows it's been years since I last played on a game console), and that we did, in turns. We had a nice time, but in between that I was coding. I added more features to my IRC bot project.

I returned to Bariga for the weekend.

#17.01.2015


It was church day today. I attended an area combined service after the service at my assembly.

On returning home, I tried to get to some coding, but

I spent most of the evening having a chat with my old friend, Aniekan. Our conversation had intermittent breaks, but overall, it lasted into midnight. The one thing to bring out of this is that, I found myself liking her in the process.

We dis

01.39AM I think I have just laid the foundation for my first ever relationship, with Aniekan Bassey. Yes you read that right, the lady I talked about [four days ago](/).

This morning, I left Bariga for Ajah and went straight to my friend's office, where my team has been using as workspace since the previous year.

The day was supposed to be spent on working on our codebase, but for whatever reasons, I couldn't bring myself to do any work.

I kept reminiscing about my conversation with Anieka.

At night, I called her and tried to follow-up on our previous conversation, but she was busy at the time. She said to call me back, but I had slept off when her calls and messages reeled in

I made my official request for a relationship with Aniekan today. I almost can't believe I'm doing this. Last year, I kept reassuring myself I wouldn't think about any lady, but I found myself praying, towards the end of the year, asking God to connect me with my wife to be. Now, here I am asking someone to date me so early on in the year.

I had a discussion with my friend, Precious Kanalichukwu, and we addressed some issues surrounding Christian Rap. The ministry is received differently by different people.

Personally, I feel the guys at the very top Lecrae, Trip Lee and Tedashii and others should endeavour to behave as they are in public eye, and people would try to emulate them.

There's lot's of opinion which I've previously shared in about Lecrea falling out. I think the fact is, everyone has is standing and conviction before God. However, I still think the best way any Christian can serve is through self--denial. There are several things which seem contradictory to Christian culture, which some folks feel convinced are ikay, while others do not.

The fact is that, you should always be careful not to lead others into sin. 

Recently I was thinking about how to listen to Christian Rap, and thought, it's probably best to just get the lyrics and read them alogside enjoying the tunes. The message contained in these songs is their crux.

This whole discussion came about when Precious approached me with the news of the release of Lecrae's album "Church Clothes 3".

I thought about this: "addressing the issue rather than dressing it."

So I sat my first Java certification exam (1z0-803) today and failed.

While walking some time after the exam, feeling somewhat disappointed, I saw the wreckage of a ghastly accident that claimed lives. At that point, I knew to be thankful.

I spoke my mum after the exam, and was surprised she wanted me to sit the examination again almost immediately.

I really don't want to bother myself about these exams -- at least no yet.

Last night Mr Sam had asked me to represent him at a meeting at the church. So, that I did this morning. In the meeting, these topics were examined:
+ Those who know their God
+ Victory in Christ
+ Forgiveness


These topics gave rise to questions like:

+ After "knowing" Christ, is there room for complaints?
+ Should you tell new converts that life in Christ is not devoid of challenges, even when you reassure them of their victory in Christ?

I went on from there to spend the most of my day at our makeshift workspace.
We tried to get a few things in place for the job for which we intend to submit a proposal on Monday. Being a Saturday, we also spent some of the time playing soccer video games. I played about two football matches.

Meanwhile I got these awesome soundtracks from the FIFA game:

I returned to Bariga today for the weekend.

On my way to Bariga, Ilistened to a sermon on wealth that played om the radio throufh the journey.

Only ruthless men can retain riches.

Today, there was a TEDX event at FUTMinna.

Reading some things about effective paper reading tonight. I have learnt that the proper approach to adopt in read an academic paper is to first ask yourself the question of what you intend to gain from the paper.

You should start by going through the abstract. Then, the introduction. and then the conclusion of the paper. Doing this will help familiarize you with the goal of the paper.

You then go into the paper "reading without breaking". You don't allow unnecessary pauses or breaks. You just read through hoping that some things would be clarified as you read on. You could bookmark confusing parts.

For one thing, I'm glad I got my head cleared today and got back to some serious work.

Learnt about Skylar

Got the first comment on the blog

Mentored a few folks about getting familiar with the coding afventure. I find that my recently more frequent visits to social networks is turning me into the "[social programmer](…)". 

I've made a couple of acquaintances. From my foray into the Cameroonian developer community (thanks to Aniekan), passing by the Rwandan mozilla dev community and the Ubuntu Linux users community.

I've found lots of new projects on Github; followed a couple of devs. Made new friends on IRC -- my goto social community.


I got thinking about time management. I find it's such an expensive entity. Time Management might be be a good addition to the sc


I have yet to find something more expensive than "time". I will

I attended Stellar.org's fireside chat today at the Idea Hub, Yaba Lagos. It was an enlightening event. One that may well be my gateway into the world of open source in this year.

No doubt this will present a somewhat steep learning curve knowing that my background in finance (and FinTech) is not much to write home about. The experience and payoffs will of course be worth the while and I am expecting more developers to join the train as the platform is still very welcoming at this point.

 Most of the details of the workings of Stellar are still very unclear to m, but a few things I've been able to make sense of include:

Two terms: node and anchor
Stellar maintains an open ledger of transactions. Financial institutions subscribed to the stellar service can offer Stellar credits.

I am optimistic that once I tie myself in the loop of working on the code and working with the leads I get from time to time, it would all clear out in due course.

I joined Stellar's Slack team @ http://stellar-public.slack.com. So far I've been received with warm arms.

The project I'm looking to contribute to lives @ github.com/stellarcn/…


During the event, we were split into teams to address different issues based on our interests. The group I went with was that of Scotts' (@nullstyle), where we addressed technical issues. Scott tried to work us through the technical nitty-gritties: innerworkings, stack and how-to-get-started. 

Scott was the first Engineer at Stellar and he is a very experienced developer from what I've gathered. He is also technically sound -- so I've seen myself. He claims to be the most appropriate a person who knows most of the code that has been written as yet.

Sometimes in learning something, you have to go back to the roots of that thing. That is what learning about Stellar has been like.

Reading one thing leads to another. From learning about to Lumens to learning about cryptocurrencies, to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripplecoin and Altcoin. Then Paypal which dates far back.

I spent most of today trying to polish an email for a Programmer job opening, only to learn after sending de that the recipient was Mr Gideon, the same person who interviewed me for the nIIT job which I apploed for last year.

Earlier i tried to update my blog post about Ununtu Africa.

I've spent most of this week at our makeshift office. Rather than being a time of acceleration, it's been a generally distracting week.

Don't kill life log. I started reading about "keeping a diary" today. Most of what I saw pointed back at what I had been doing with life log before complacency set in.

Indeeed being a consistent writer, regardless of the subject area or content requires real dedication.

I now have to seek ways, "hacks" if you'd like, to become more punctual in my writings.

Today, I tried to be less talkative and be both more organized and focused. I found I was more productive.

Although after my morning meal at our makeshift workspace, and after getting some work done on preparing a business plan, there was power failure that lasted a while.

So today I got my Kindle ebook reading device. So far I love it. I learned it uses an electronic paper that uses reflective technology, making it seem like real paper.

But there's a downside -- my major disappointment with it so far; it I can't use it at night without some sort of light source.

Notwithstanding, I have sideloaded lots of ebooks (mostly PDFs) from my computer.

My journey in the morning had me use a boat ferry. With myself, another passenger and two folks from the boar company, we set off on the journey that would last 10 minutes.

This evening in a --' discussion with my friend Segun -- I told my dad's tale. How he once told my mum he'd forgiven all her sins, which he'd recorded in his diary. Funny.

I listened to a radio program in which the subject of "Fargos" was treated.

And another that had muslim clerics call in. One of them outrightly condemned Valentine's Day.

I was in a public mass transit bus that was fully air conditioned. People still stand on these buses. SMH

At Krohx, we have been having some workload on us recently. A lot of events have followed themseleves: from launching our Facebook page and website (currently still hosted on Github through their Github pages feature) to creating new logos (thanks to the design prowess of Seyi, our newest member) for both company and one of our products - JobNowNow.

I'm really happy all of this is happening fast -- maybe not fast enough -- but we are showing some spirit.

However, it's not all glittery as some of seem to be showing some slack, complacency if you'd like. I feel such times come, but we need to encourage ourselves and fill in the gaps for ourselves.

I met Mrs Joke Demuren, who owns a bookstore at Ikota complex. This was after Mr Sam whom I stay with had left me with her as he was runnning late for work; so he handed over his duty to me.

I got into more interesting intellectually-centered chats with the woman, and this culminated in a job -- a book review (plus other things) job.



February Week 1

Last week I went from sending applications to two programmer jobs. I had some battling with setting up Postgres with Flask; used several tutorials but itjust wasn't going to be something I would get so easily.

Deji got some unlimited internet, which I used in running updates and downloading some new stuff: largely videos and software. I also got the offline version of the entire Mozilla Dev Network, available here.

Through a friend, Aniekan, I learnt about the AIESEC organization.


I decided to create this gallery -- The Army -- a curation of people I've encountered who have to do with Tech and or Entrepreneurship.


Project thoughts:
Forkhub local repo caching
Pelican feature to filter categories on home page
Game to help understand the concept of StellarOrg


Thanks to @Thiefmaster and @ergo_ on IRC, I started learning about Docker and Ansible.
