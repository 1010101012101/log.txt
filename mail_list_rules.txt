Mailling List Etiquette:


- Do your research before asking.

- Keep the message short enough.

- Don't post code or log output. (Post a link to it instead)

- No attachments. (Post a link to it instead)

- No HTML mail; stick with plain text.

- Start a new topic if the subject is new and has not been previously discussed; otherwise post your 'reply' to the already existing thread.

- Use a clear, concise and in-context subject line.

- Use bottom, interleaved posting versus top-posting. Let your reply appear directly below the message you are replying to, and trim off the irrelevant parts of the message. (Some email softwares would prepend each line of the message you are responding to with a '>').

- Avoid cross-posting. Do not CC multiple lists with the same message.

- Use short messages in your signature. And avoid huge disclaimer messages.

- Avoid repetitive posting.

- Be polite, use proper language. Avoid using uppercase letters unnecessarily, so you don't appear to be shouting at your readers.
