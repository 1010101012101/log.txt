	on: SMERP - A Cloud-based solution for businesses

ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning, a software for business accounting

Maintains records such as: Product, Marketing, Shipping, Inventory, Payments
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) - Essentially translates to a Pay-as-you-use system


Features:
- It provides one integrated system for all departments
- It is cost efficient - E.g. no extra server costs, less expenses on resources
- There is improved flow of communication
- Little or no data replication (data integrity is maintained)


Easy implementation:
	SMERP is a modular application; so you get what suits/is-needed-by your particular business. It is web-based, so it is cross-platform
