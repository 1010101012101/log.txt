** Can you attend to this mind-boggling questions of an intending writer?
- As a writer, do you need to know the end of a story before beginning at all?
- A little bit about myself:
Up until now (@22), I have had countless moments of whim for reading and (or) writing. Sadly, I have had little luck getting up-to-speed on either activity. On a bright note, I can say that I have over the past few weeks covered the following books out of sheer determination.
…
Having mentally connected with the few authors whose works I have recently digested, I have begun to feel my cravings for writing begin to come alive again, but I'm faced with two things:
   -  I am unable to come up with a good story
   -  I do not even know where to start, with the few topics of interest that come to mind.

Also, I am unsure as to whether most writers just seem to know a lot about everything that shows up in their writeups. As an instance, a writer talks extensively about the military as if he were in the military and then masterfully discuss the topic of medicine, only for him to stray to something related to agriculture or the business world or something as if either was his day job.

** Is my writing of good quality?
**Disclaimer**
I have no intention to spam or garner traffic with this question. I simply need your professional/non-professional opinions.


It took me about twelve hours (sleep time included) to put up this Facebook post (*see link below)just because I wanted it to look as literary as possible; TBT, also because I wanted to play with words so I found myself going in and out of my dictionary intermittently.
- Do you think it was worth all that time?
- Do you think it's a good writeup for someone who has had a craving for wtiting for long but hasn't been able to get much out there?

** How should christians react to non-christian songs?
- Should a christian listen to secular* music if he feels like?

Sometime ago, I used to listen a lot of songs spanning a wide range of genres. I particularly enjoyed rap, so I listened a lot to the likes of T.I, Maybach crew, Kanye West and all. Howbeit, I made a resolve to stop listening to these 'curse-dominated' kinds of songs, so I 'Shift+Del[eted]' such songs from my computer.

It's been two years now, but after consistently limiting my self to gospel songs, I am inclined to play some relaxing songs (likes of Adele, Leona-Lewis) as their melancholy tends to make me concentrate when reading or computer-coding; I also play some Yanni and Enya. But should I feel guilty about this? Is it wrong to listen to this kinds of songs?

In addition, I still play rap songs but only the christian ones from folks like Lecrae, Da-Truth, TripLee...

* I mean the ones with no vulgar words.

** "Is there a potential danger in using a charger with a different power rating to power (not 'charge', because it will not charge) my laptop?

- I have this big battery about half-the-size-of a car battery  but about as heavy, which I use to supply to my laptop since there are frequent power outages.

I have used this device for the past two years hitch-free (except I said, it doesn't charge my laptop battery; it just powers my laptop).

The power pack that connects to my laptop has these ratings:



My laptop's regular charger has the following ratings (same as those of my previous laptop, which I also used with the laptop):


Recently, the 'head' part of the battery's power pack that plugs into the  computer started having some partial contacts, and after a series of 'twists and turns' of the defaulting cable, its state has apparently degenerated so I opted for cutting wire from an old charger for a replacement.

Sadly enough, the new cable hasn't  been perfect. Whenever I disconnect it, my laptop just goes off, it doesn't fall back to battery power.


What could be causing this?"
