There is a contest
My mind is the ring
The fighters are my interests
This whole play camouflaged as thinking

Soon there'll be a conquest
Then I can feel relieved
A question stands out though
What are they all fighting for?

The answer is subtle
The medal is golden
They are gunning for Time
It's all going on in my mind

My mind is akin to a Unix server
I have different talents and hobbies
These are my users
I will have to implement Time Sharing

My mind is a hangar
Ideas taxing in and out
Eureka is a banger
My breath times-out

My mind is a race track
My thoughts, the runners
The winners, my acts
Question is: who are the loosers?

My mind is yet another puzzle
Waiting to be solved
But will it ever be unriddled
The mystery that sits atop of it all


================#####=================
Change is constant
Time is variant
Seasons come and go
Change is always the goal

Change is not new
It is just a different view
New is change

"So I answer her question one more time hoping it would be the last of what seemed to be a hundred times already. I honestly couldn't place this question quite rightly. Was it meant to be rhetoric? No, that would mean I didn't need to give a response, which would be rude, given our strong hold on cultural values."

"It can't be! It laid there only a minute ago. Wait a minute," he said, as he swiftly made for the door, ducking-out his head first and holding on to either side of the wooden frame with each hand. "He must have gone this way," his head now turned leftwards. At first he intended to follow his instincts and go right after the unknown man whom had just eloped with his phone, he quickly realised that this was a lost battle. His head plummeted, facing the floor, but still held back by his neck which was now hanging on to his collar bone.

I am a Painter; I paint with words
My tongue is the painting brush
My voice, the ink
My statements, the pieces

But for your listening minds
I would have no canvas
Because these words would just die as they are birthed
Now I can step back to behold a finished work of art


I am so many things
Actually I want to be so many things
Even a killer
So I can kill my evil thoughts

I want to be a…

I have seen that before. Yes. This is not the first and I can bet it would take an unprecedented kind of miracle to make that even the penultimate.

What bothers me now is that you seem bothered.
Why, shouldn't I be?
Hey, you can take this with a grain of salt; but my sincerest opinion: you shouldn't. This has literally become music to our ears.
So what, shall I dance to it's sordid tune?

You know sarcasm is like salt: put little more than needed in your broth and … you know the rest.

With the current situation of the country, and of course the upcoming primaries, no one should be surprised if an explosion rocked his garage. What can we do? Aren't we merely rookies, with the big players up there running the show to favor their pot-bellies?

I bet all we can do now is to pray our heads do not get served up next while one of them makes his move on the other.

I couldn't agree more. It's all a game; and you know the thing about games? Not only are there winners and loosers, there are unfortunately, casualties. If you get lucky to be POW, then there is that glimpse of hope.

Let's get our behinds out of here as quickly as possible. The feds are going to be sweeping the whole place before you know it. They always get in on the action; only ever late.

After you, please.

I have the feeling that my emotions are wrapped up in the world of whatever book I'm reading at an instant.

There are voices in my head screaming for emancipation; the result? I am itching to get a lot more scribbling done.
I feel like I own these pieces that want to be free, but they need my help.

You know the intrigues of wrapping yourself around the fictional characters; often feeling empathy for the weak ones.

Truth

Truth is cold, it chills your spines
Truth is hot, it burns your eyes

Truth is old, it has lived through time
Truth is young, can you outlive it

Truth is bitter, it inflicts sorrow on the wicked
Truth is sweet, it's joy to the just is limitless

"Never had he needed to be this straight-legged in his life until now. All that stood between him and his target was a few hundred centimetres. Tade on tiptoes moved closer and closer to close the distance and ge was now standing inches away from what had kept him planning for three straight nights to secure. Now that his mission was nearing it's successful completion, he breathed the first sigh of relief and immediately swung back to action." Tade was only a few blocks away when a bleep sound from his package startled him.

The air is dampened
You're almost certain there was a heavy downpour
But you quickly realise what happened
There was but a different kind of fall

The ground is gummy
Does that explain why the air is muggy
I look around and see them in their colonies
So united they remind you of an army

The groups were set free
For a little more than a moment they felt ease
They must have spewed all these 
-- wet bees

Busy Hole
My mind is a busy hole
Although it is not a burrow
It is more like a mine

Even though they sound alike
My mind does have a silent noise
A mine has an unpleasant song

In is a busy hole
My mind, in it I keep all the treasures I've stolen
From reading people's works
Or from hearing people talk

Talking EPL: From a Gunner's perspective

You can take a peek at the league table at the moment and be sure to pull a wide grin. One can't help the sensation that some ray of hope looms as current standings show that a mere four (4) points seperates us from the 'top spotters'.

That glimmer may be quickly dashed out the window though once you become aware of the fact that the league leaders are currently still two games short. Add-in their resilient spirit as we've seen them display and you could ignore the fact that in the remaining eight matches lie a potential 24 points that could transcend the fate of our North London side. 

Even though I would want for the team to keep up her winning streak till finish. I must admit, in accordance with reality, and you'll agree with me that that is highly unlikely to be the turn of events.

Want my take? I say we have a potential for the penultimate spot, so we should gun for that instead, even though it's almost becoming second nature for the team to finish off with runner-up honours. Howbeit, who says there's a crime in eyeing the golden top spot? We can only hope that the present occupants would somehow trip, relinquishing their title to us.

As for the 'City' in front of us, we'll leave them to tangle with their 'derby neighbours' who have trailed us as proximately as possible.

Let's just hope they don't 'get United' (no pun intended) for obvious reasons … ;)


Happy Sunday fellas!

I gitbox it

I find it handy to keep a lot of stuffs in text files for easy offline reference. From my most  frequently used commands to the short notes I take while learning new things. Configuration settings that I might or might not be able to reuse. You know, these things can take long to tweak at times, so having them saved for reuse can be a tad useful.

For those who use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, you may not find this to be of much use to you. However, if like me, you use a Linux box and have difficulties setting up a cloud backup service, then you can  take a seat, relax and learn how to use git to get your own git-based sync service running.

Create a folder on your computer to hold the files you wish to backup. Ensure to give it a proper name as this would be name for your git repository when set up.

To begin, navigate to the folder above in your terminal and type "git init". To see the curent status of your git repository, type "git status".

To begin adding files for tracking, type "git add ." followed by "git commit". Your default text editor would immediately launch and you can type some message to indicate that this is your first commit.

My interview (stage 1)



Mr Ben walked in as always and joked about my incessant use of the Linux operating system playfully calling me "the Linux man". I playfully retorted saying, "You guys jad better employed me and let me teach Linux and Android Development".

Even though I had said that without expecting to be taken serious, I was taken by surprise when he asked me to send him my CV immediately.

I did send the curriculum vitae but not until almost a week afterwards after his incessant calls for me to do so. Lo I received a call from the headquarters informing me of a scheduled interview two days from the time.

Thursday the 3rd of September, there I was sitting amongst 4 other applicants whom I'd assess as being better edged than myself viz-a-viz paper qualifications.

Stop following this blog!
--------------------------


Uhmm.. I think you read that right, and I did not write this post while sleepwalking. In fact, I have been awake a long time and I am not quite sleepy as yet.

Without any doubt, I have not been the most dedicated blogger. I agree I started out with so much enthusiasm. But you know that happens to a lot of us when we make new resolutions; we often follow our resolutions with persistence. Only sadly enough, that persistence is often shortlived.

It's been months since my procrastination had sprung forth, again! Yes, I was that enthusiastic blogger at the beginning who had so much plans for "things (writings) to come up". I had envisaged a good and enjoyable writing journey. Apparently, that hasn't quite been the state of things. However, I believe I'm back, except that this time I'll be honest and not promise any form of consistency. You see, I still hold that dream of a good writing course; so in the meantime, I will simply endeavour to keep up with updating this blog.

Now, while I don't want to bug you with the Quora notifications of my sporadic blog posts -- and trust me here, I know the feeling: I too hate it when I get those annoying buzzers -- I am asking you to chill out a while. Let me get the blog to some state of fairly consistent posts. I am doing this with the hope that when I do ask you to return to "reading me", you would be kind enough to accept my humble invitation. However, I am not compelling you to do this. It's just that I think it would be in your best interest if you don't like getting post notifications from a staggering blogger/writer like myself.

This is how I plan to bounce back and I hope you understand my rationale. Of course, I am open to suggestions or ideas from you my readers (you still are, even after you may leave; plus the URL has not changed).

Overall, my aim is to overcome procrastination, but I also know it won't come easy. Everyday activities: school, work, church, working on personal projects, family and commuting, for me, are the usual competitors for my time. I have yet to come up with a strategy to qualitatively manage my time. So if you have any suggestions on that as well, kindly drop them in the comment box that lives just below here.

I'm in a vehicle travelling to Ilishan Remo where my sister's school is situated.

A couple of thoughts running through my mind and I'm doing my usual pondering.

One question I'm pondering on now is why some people would feign reluctance to use some technology and over time covertly subscribe to use same. I mean, why hate the tech in the first place?

On a different  note,  I see myself tending towards a disciplinary charisma. I am especially strict with people in my own circle (worthy of mention would be my sister), sometimes even with some not-so-close people.

Thinking about leadership, I feel the first task every "boss" should embark upon should be that of building a ladder that connects his high horse to his followers. I cannot overemphasise the importance of building a close warm relationship with the people you lead.

The general state of our public vehicles show thay the motorists have a flawed perception that vehicles used for transportation should not be properly maintained.

================#####=================

Can we have more ways to indulge our uneducated youths? I think while we seek how we can provide employments for the educated populace, we should also put their uneducated counterparts in "gainful busyness". This would drastically reduce crime rates in my opinion.

================#####=================

The syntax for Markdown is something I started looking at (again) last night, having looked at it sometime ago. It's really easy to learn, especially when compared with HTML. I feel every programmer who might want to learn to write its syntax should make it their constant way of writing any plain text notes. It doesn't really get in the way of the content, so reading won't be a hassle.

I will try to find out how markdown differs from rst.

How can we get people to be more committed to their jobs? How can people find dignity in their jobs?

After a class today, Mr Jeffrey  (an NIIT marketing staff) who had sat through the class told me he observed that I was strict with the students. This confirms my thoughts with regards to me having a disciplinary demeanour.

With Great COMMITments
---------------------------


These two articles [links below*] are definitely worth your time if you are looking to learn some good habits. Asides their evangelism of good practices, they have both helped me appreciate the usefulness of such a powerful tool, another geeky contribution of our genius Linus Torvalds. This tool, which is described in her official Man Pages as "the stupid content tracker" is Git. Git is a collaborative development tool -- there is a technical jargon: "Distributed Version Control System" -- and as such should be used with others (team members or collaborators) in mind.

* Here are the links:

    Deliberate Git - Rake Routes
    How to Write a Git Commit Message


Perhaps you haven't heard of Git or do not know its purpose. So I'll put it simply: Git is useful for at least two things:

    Multiple people working on the same project can make changes to the same file or set of files at the same time without necessarily messing up another person's changes.
    You have a long -- very long -- fully detailed history (log) of all your file changes.



Now, these are things I don't see you doing manually without getting easily frustrated.

I am not going to try to re-write what these awesome guys have taking the pain (or joy if you'd like) to blog about. That's why I shared the links up there. Go soak up the information for yourself.

As with any standard tool, there are standard guidelines for the use of Git. However, some of these rules are often not hard-and-fast rules that you have to follow religiously. You can sometimes bend things, but not without motive. In those posts (mentioned above), the authors offer guides that have worked for them over time but you are not under compulsion to strictly observe any of them. In my opinion, what counts is your consistency and your rationale for choosing whatever style guides you decide to go with. In essence, do things to be productive and avoid getting in the way of others, even yourself. Stick with doing things in a way that is easily communicable within your team.

It is often the case, as I've found that people just want to get things done in a hurry and see the outcome of their work. While, that is not entirely a bad thing to do, the subtle things you fail to do at times could come hunt you with the course of time. So that one-liner comment you were too lazy to write while coding up your brand new application, may just be the one to get you back on track when someone revisits that section of your code later. Bear in mind that that 'someone' could very well be you.

Honestly, in the Git world, I am still very much a newbie. Even though I've known about this tool for quite some time, I haven't been actively using it. This is largely because prior to this moment, I always found Git concepts difficult to wrap my mind around -- I've seen many people say the same thing online. But I've kept coming back to it and I think I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, for one thing, I'm glad I'm learning these good practices early on. It's a well known fact that unlearning is a lot more of a difficult task than learning the bad habits in the first instance.

This is not some technical prose, so I won't be given any git howtos or typing some code here. The important point to draw from here is that:

    "with great commits come great commitments" 


Any regular Git user would understand and agree with that.

Git has its good parts and evils, but because it's just a stupid innocent tool, I'm going to be both kind and moderate here. I won't go on waxing lyrical about the good parts, and I won't even discuss the bad habits that Git obstinately refused to drop despite mama's appeals.

Within the last two weeks, I have created several repositories within my Linux machine. For some of them, I have setup remote repositories on the social source code hosting site called Github[1] -- that is arguably the most popular website when you speak about open source development. I like the ease of use of Github. They provide good tutorials too. But, for my team's projects, which are not yet fit for public consumption, I will stick with Bitbucket which offers me free private repositories.

Raised with a silver spoo

Although born in one of the most awkward ways known to man, Mark's birth wasn't a totally strange one. His mnother had been squatting on a pit laterine when providence had it that he had reached his destination after a rather long journey of nine months. Yes he had gotten to his destination, but his timimg was awfully near-fatal as he only managed to stay atop the laterine by the help of his slightly big head, which held him back from falling with the rest of his mother's faeces.

Life definitely had more surprises for this creature as he wasn't going be greeted with a warm life afterall.

Points towards my forthcoming presentation at NIIT
-------------------------------------------------------

At the TECH+ event which I attended recently, one of the panelists pointed out that there are sectors such as AGRICULTURE and TRANSPORTATION which could benefit from technology (apps in this case) that have yet to be tapped into. I consciously registered this comment.

I like to think that "data is gold". Google uses crowdsourced information to improve her map software. In like manner, we have decided upon using surveys through Google forms to get people to submit the needed data for this app. Afterall, what would be the point in creating this app if there was no data to work upon.

This project is still in its first phase. We will improve upon it, and get it much closer to the users by putting the app on their smartphones.

Have we used an optimized algorithm versus an approach based on exhaustive enumeration?
