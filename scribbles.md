There is a contest
My mind is the ring
The fighters are my interests
This whole play camouflaged as thinking

Soon there'll be a conquest
Then I can feel relieved
A question stands out though
What are they all fighting for?

The answer is subtle
The medal is golden
They are gunning for Time
It's all going on in my mind

My mind is akin to a Unix server
I have different talents and hobbies
These are my users
I will have to implement Time Sharing

My mind is a hangar
Ideas taxing in and out
Eureka is a banger
My breath times-out

My mind is a race track
My thoughts, the runners
The winners, my acts
Question is: who are the loosers?

My mind is yet another puzzle
Waiting to be solved
But will it ever be unriddled
The mystery that sits atop of it all

Change is constant
Time is variant
Seasons come and go

"So I answer her question one more time hoping it would be the last of what seemed to be a hundred times already. I honestly couldn't place this question quite rightly. Was it meant to be rhetoric? No, that would mean I didn't need to give a response, which would be rude, given our strong hold on cultural values."

"It can't be! It laid there only a minute ago. Wait a minute," he said, as he swiftly made for the door, ducking-out his head first and holding on to either side of the wooden frame with each hand. "He must have gone this way," his head now turned leftwards. At first he intended to follow his instincts and go right after the unknown man whom had just eloped with his phone, he quickly realised that this was a lost battle. His head plummeted, facing the floor, but still held back by his neck which was now hanging on to his collar bone.

I am a Painter; I paint with words
My tongue is the painting brush
My voice, the ink
My statements, the pieces

But for your listening minds
I would have no canvas
Because these words would just die as they are birthed
Now I can step back to behold a finished work of art


I am so many things
Actually I want to be so many things
Even a killer
So I can kill my evil thoughts

I want to be a…

I have seen that before. Yes. This is not the first and I can bet it would take an unprecedented kind of miracle to make that even the penultimate.

What bothers me now is that you seem bothered.
Why, shouldn't I be?
Hey, you can take this with a grain of salt; but my sincerest opinion: you shouldn't. This has literally become music to our ears.
So what, shall I dance to it's sordid tune?

You know sarcasm is like salt: put little more than needed in your broth and … you know the rest.

With the current situation of the country, and of course the upcoming primaries, no one should be surprised if an explosion rocked his garage. What can we do? Aren't we merely rookies, with the big players up there running the show to favor their pot-bellies?

I bet all we can do now is to pray our heads do not get served up next while one of them makes his move on the other.

I couldn't agree more. It's all a game; and you know the thing about games? Not only are there winners and loosers, there are unfortunately, casualties. If you get lucky to be POW, then there is that glimpse of hope.

Let's get our behinds out of here as quickly as possible. The feds are going to be sweeping the whole place before you know it. They always get in on the action; only ever late.

I have the feeling that my emotions are wrapped up in the world of whatever book I'm reading at an instant.

Talking EPL: From a Gunner's perspective

You can take a peek at the league table at the moment and be sure to pull a wide grin. One can't help the sensation that some ray of hope looms as current standings show that a mere four (4) points seperates us from the 'top spotters'.

That glimmer may be quickly dashed out the window though once you become aware of the fact that the league leaders are currently still two games short. Add-in their resilient spirit as we've seen them display and you could ignore the fact that in the remaining eight matches lie a potential 24 points that could transcend the fate of our North London side. 

Even though I would want for the team to keep up her winning streak till finish. I must admit, in accordance with reality, and you'll agree with me that that is highly unlikely to be the turn of events.

Want my take? I say we have a potential for the penultimate spot, so we should gun for that instead, even though it's almost becoming second nature for the team to finish off with runner-up honours. Howbeit, who says there's a crime in eyeing the golden top spot? We can only hope that the present occupants would somehow trip, relinquishing their title to us.

As for the 'City' in front of us, we'll leave them to tangle with their 'derby neighbours' who have trailed us as proximately as possible.

Let's just hope they don't 'get United' (no pun intended) for obvious reasons … ;)


Happy Sunday fellas!

I gitbox it

I find it handy to keep a lot of stuffs in text files for easy offline reference. From my most  frequently used commands to the short notes I take while learning new things. Configuration settings that I might or might not be able to reuse. You know, these things can take long to tweak at times, so having them saved for reuse can be a tad useful.

For those who use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, you may not find this to be of much use to you. However, if like me, you use a Linux box and have difficulties setting up a cloud backup service, then you can  take a seat, relax and learn how to use git to get your own git-based sync service running.

Create a folder on your computer to hold the files you wish to backup. Ensure to give it a proper name as this would be name for your git repository when set up.

To begin, navigate to the folder above in your terminal and type "git init". To see the curent status of your git repository, type "git status".

To begin adding files for tracking, type "git add ." followed by "git commit". Your default text editor would immediately launch and you can type some message to indicate that this is your first commit.

To ease things up a bit, I have decided to use my programming prowess to create a tool to streamline this process. The caveat to beware of is that this setup is best suited for managing text-files.

In my usual wandering around the web, I stumbled upon a tool that makes the process of file conflicts resolution seem like sugar. This tool goes by the name "Meld". And guess what, it's written in Python. No joke: since discovering this tool, I have anticipated more and more merge conflicts in dealing with version controlling. It's just such a neat process to be able to look at two or three more files that are paradoxically both similar and dissimilar and be able to sync their contents by hand so fluidly.

My interview (stage 1)



Mr Ben walked in as always and joked about my incessant use of the Linux operating system playfully calling me "the Linux man". I playfully retorted saying, "You guys jad better employed me and let me teach Linux and Android Development".

Even though I had said that without expecting to be taken serious, I was taken by surprise when he asked me to send him my CV immediately.

I did send the curriculum vitae but not until almost a week afterwards after his incessant calls for me to do so. Lo I received a call from the headquarters informing me of a scheduled interview two days from the time.

Thursday the 3rd of September, there I was sitting amongst 4 other applicants whom I had assessed as being better edged than myself viz-a-viz paper qualifications.

Stop following this blog!
--------------------------


Uhmm.. I think you read that right, and I did not write this post while sleepwalking. In fact, I have been awake a long time and I am not quite sleepy as yet.

Without any doubt, I have not been the most dedicated blogger. I agree I started out with so much enthusiasm. But you know that happens to a lot of us when we make new resolutions; we often follow our resolutions with persistence. Only sadly enough, that persistence is often shortlived.

It's been months since my procrastination had sprung forth, again! Yes, I was that enthusiastic blogger at the beginning who had so much plans for "things (writings) to come up". I had envisaged a good and enjoyable writing journey. Apparently, that hasn't quite been the state of things. However, I believe I'm back, except that this time I'll be honest and not promise any form of consistency. You see, I still hold that dream of a good writing course; so in the meantime, I will simply endeavour to keep up with updating this blog.

Now, while I don't want to bug you with the Quora notifications of my sporadic blog posts -- and trust me here, I know the feeling: I too hate it when I get those annoying buzzers -- I am asking you to chill out a while. Let me get the blog to some state of fairly consistent posts. I am doing this with the hope that when I do ask you to return to "reading me", you would be kind enough to accept my humble invitation. However, I am not compelling you to do this. It's just that I think it would be in your best interest if you don't like getting post notifications from a staggering blogger/writer like myself.

This is how I plan to bounce back and I hope you understand my rationale. Of course, I am open to suggestions or ideas from you my readers (you still are, even after you may leave; plus the URL has not changed).

Overall, my aim is to overcome procrastination, but I also know it won't come easy. Everyday activities: school, work, church, working on personal projects, family and commuting, for me, are the usual competitors for my time. I have yet to come up with a strategy to qualitatively manage my time. So if you have any suggestions on that as well, kindly drop them in the comment box that lives just below here.

I'm in a vehicle travelling to Ilishan Remo where my sister's school is situated.

A couple of thoughts running through my mind and I'm doing my usual pondering.

One question I'm pondering on now is why some people would feign reluctance to use some technology and over time covertly subscribe to use same. I mean, why hate the tech in the first place?

On a different  note,  I see myself tending towards a disciplinary charisma. I am especially strict with people in my own circle (worthy of mention would be my sister), sometimes even with some not-so-close people.

Thinking about leadership, I feel the first task every "boss" should embark upon should be that of building a ladder that connects his high horse to his followers. I cannot overemphasise the importance of building a close warm relationship with the people you lead.

# The Developer Arsenal

Every programmer should possess certain skills. These skills are language-agnostic.

- GIT
- Markdown
- RST
- SSH
- FTP
- Bash (or some other shell)


Keep a history of your workflow with __Git__.

The syntax for Markdown is something I started looking at (again) last night, having looked at it sometime ago. It's really easy to learn, especially when compared with HTML. I feel every programmer who might want to learn to write its syntax should make it their constant way of writing any plain text notes. It doesn't really get in the way of the content, so reading won't be a hassle.

I will try to find out how markdown differs from rst.

With Great COMMITments
---------------------------

These two articles [links below*] are definitely worth your time if you are looking to learn some good habits. Asides their evangelism of good practices, they have both helped me appreciate the usefulness of such a powerful tool, another geeky contribution of our genius Linus Torvalds. This tool, which is described in her official Man Pages as "the stupid content tracker" is Git. Git is a collaborative development tool -- there is a technical jargon: "Distributed Version Control System" -- and as such should be used with others (team members or collaborators) in mind.

* Here are the links:
	- Delibrate Git - http://rakeroutes.com/blog/deliberate-git/
	- How to Write a Git Commit Message - http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit


Perhaps you haven't heard of Git or do not know its purpose. So I'll put it simply: Git is useful for at least two things:

    Multiple people working on the same project can make changes to the same file or set of files at the same time without necessarily messing up another person's changes.
    You have a long -- very long -- fully detailed history (log) of all your file changes.



Now, these are things I don't see you doing manually without getting easily frustrated.

I am not going to try to re-write what these awesome guys have taking the pain (or joy if you'd like) to blog about. That's why I shared the links up there. Go soak up the information for yourself.

As with any standard tool, there are standard guidelines for the use of Git. However, some of these rules are often not hard-and-fast rules that you have to follow religiously. You can sometimes bend things, but not without motive. In those posts (mentioned above), the authors offer guides that have worked for them over time but you are not under compulsion to strictly observe any of them. In my opinion, what counts is your consistency and your rationale for choosing whatever style guides you decide to go with. In essence, do things to be productive and avoid getting in the way of others, even yourself. Stick with doing things in a way that is easily communicable within your team.

It is often the case, as I've found that people just want to get things done in a hurry and see the outcome of their work. While, that is not entirely a bad thing to do, the subtle things you fail to do at times could come hunt you with the course of time. So that one-liner comment you were too lazy to write while coding up your brand new application, may just be the one to get you back on track when someone revisits that section of your code later. Bear in mind that that 'someone' could very well be you.

Honestly, in the Git world, I am still very much a newbie. Even though I've known about this tool for quite some time, I haven't been actively using it. This is largely because prior to this moment, I always found Git concepts difficult to wrap my mind around -- I've seen many people say the same thing online. But I've kept coming back to it and I think I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, for one thing, I'm glad I'm learning these good practices early on. It's a well known fact that unlearning is a lot more of a difficult task than learning the bad habits in the first instance.

This is not some technical prose, so I won't be given any git howtos or typing some code here. The important point to draw from here is that:

    "with great commits come great commitments" 


Any regular Git user would understand and agree with that.

Git has its good parts and evils, but because it's just a stupid innocent tool, I'm going to be both kind and moderate here. I won't go on waxing lyrical about the good parts, and I won't even discuss the bad habits that Git obstinately refused to drop despite mama's appeals.

Within the last two weeks, I have created several repositories within my Linux machine. For some of them, I have setup remote repositories on the social source code hosting site called Github[1] -- that is arguably the most popular website when you speak about open source development. I like the ease of use of Github. They provide good tutorials too. But, for my team's projects, which are not yet fit for public consumption, I will stick with Bitbucket which offers me free private repositories.

Although born in one of the most awkward ways known to man, Mark's birth wasn't a totally strange one. His mnother had been squatting on a pit laterine when providence had it that he had reached his destination after a rather long journey of nine months. Yes he had gotten to his destination, but his timimg was awfully near-fatal as he only managed to stay atop the laterine by the help of his slightly big head, which held him back from falling with the rest of his mother's faeces.

Life definitely had more surprises for this creature as he wasn't going be greeted with a warm life afterall.

# What Project are you working on?


> Should you do a side project? Absolutely! That has to be a no brainer, right?

The topic of this piece is one question I have heard over and over again from all sorts of people: potential employers or investors or partners or even from my own inner voice.

The truth is, no one really cares -- well, maybe a few people do -- about what you can do. As a developer, *your prowess is measured by your demonstrations rather than your potentials*. What speaks volumes for you is what you have taken the pain to do.

Believe it or not, people care about what you have tried. For instance, if you're a startup, investors do not merely limit their concerns to your viability. What carries more weight is how your successes have levelled up against your failures -- indeed, failures do count as well, because that gives them a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of your business/team.

It's the same game that plays out in an interview room. As a developer, when potential employers speak of experience, you shouldn't narrow your scope to just experience gotten from 9 to 5 jobs. You should equally consider your personal projects: on how many challenges you have faced [and possibly overcome], and what lessons you've brought back home.

You should develop the habit of frequently taking on side projects. Always have something you are working on on the side, outside of your regular routine; it doesn't matter how big or small the project idea may be, but __endeavour to see it to completion__. Completing it is key here. Although I am telling you this, it is worth noting that I have failed at this myself. I do have a few side-projects but because I fail to complete them to at least a _demoable_ stage, I am often unable to showcase any of them when the need arises.

So start working on something today. If it is starting to become cumbersome, find someone to work on it with you. Better yet, open source it! There is a pool of hungry programmers out there, waiting to pounce on the next available interesting project.

Points towards my forthcoming presentation at NIIT
-------------------------------------------------------

At the TECH+ event which I attended recently, one of the panelists pointed out that there are sectors such as AGRICULTURE and TRANSPORTATION which could benefit from technology (apps in this case) that have yet to be tapped into. I consciously registered this comment.

I like to think that "data is gold". Google uses crowdsourced information to improve her map software. In like manner, we have decided upon using surveys through Google forms to get people to submit the needed data for this app. Afterall, what would be the point in creating this app if there was no data to work upon.

This project is still in its first phase. We will improve upon it, and get it much closer to the users by putting the app on their smartphones.

Have we used an optimized algorithm versus an approach based on exhaustive enumeration?

I saw an incompleteness im the Google map and a need for the man.

How often do you turn on data?

Yesterday, I had a prototypical pitch of AFraisr at a prototypical MMS competition.

Well, the preparations had been going on for months, but the real event took place yesterday.

In what would be a rather disappointing decision on my path, I pre-released the app to a miniature audience. In truth, this wasn't a move I made unreluctantly. In fact, I made the decision at the VERY LAST MINUTE.

I had made some progress to the router app I was working on -- I'm still working on it -- but, carelessly failed to git-commit at certain important stages. That may not have been the main issue. Something of more importance was the fact that I had a poor GUI.

My attempts to fix this resulted in uncontrollable/unresolveable bugs at the time. This ultimately led me to one saving grace: prematurely pitching AFraisr.

Well, that ends the sordid bit of the tale. The good part begins with the fact that the presentation went better than I had expected even though I had obscured some parts of the app from the intrigued audience. What followed was a series of questions that indicated the "noobness" of the audience to the concept of crowdfunding or even a crowdfunding platform.

Having done the pitch without consent from the rest of my team, I was now under the onus to apologise for my actions, which I consequently did.

That part went well as well. But "what comes afterwards?" becomes the big question. AFraisr has taken its first peep into the world. How would it be treated by a much broader audience? In about a month from now which is the prototype launch time-goal we have set for ourselves, we might get a peek into the answers to these questions.

In other events of the day, a face-off that was supposed to be the main activity for the day saw the SE students lock horns with NE students. The result? Obvious: the software guys were trumping. Truth be told though, it was an unevenly matched set of participants.

I felt inclined to write this after [name here] sent me a Quora A2A on [this question]().  

I'll paraphrase the query as "How do you go from novice to maestro on the computer?"

Actually, I can't tell you that because I have yet to become a master myself. However, I can share my experience with you.

I started out like every other person, a complete noob! In my opinion though, everyone is a noob at one thing or at one time or the other. The question I ask is, can one ever stop being noob? The simple answer is "no". I find myself being new at unfamiliar technology from time to time. Only a few weeks ago, I was a beginning user of a popular version control system, Git. When I joke about that now I say I have become ...; now living on "branches", frequently hopping from one to the other. After having used Git to manage my team's codebase for a while, I can't quite say the same for myself again. Who knows what technology I'll have to learn tomorrow: I know quite a few of them already.

Intuitiveness is a powerful skill to posess. I say 'skill' because, I find it is surprisingly lacking in a lot of IT users that I encounter. Some people, as a result of fear, fail to try out any hunches; worse yet, some do not even bother to think of possible workarounds for any technical issue they are faced with. Of course, I do not expect you to go around fixing technical hitches if you lack the necessary expertise, notwithstanding, you are not debarred from one or two troubleshooting attempts.

A very common habit with many IT end-users is that of "wanting your hands to be held while you walk along". Some folks would even prefer to have someone turn on their computers for them, no joke. During a conversation with an acquaintance a few weeks ago, Emeka[1] told me of an experience where a client came complaining that her computer had stopped working. When he got to the PC in question, he found out that the power cable had been disconnected. Funny enough, the lady knew this, but had failed to re-connect the cable for fear of an electric shock. How pathetic can people be?

So you think you want to be good with computers? Then you must first take off your garment of fear, become intuitive, and try out your hunches. In IT, you must be ready to tinker with a lot of things. A bulk of what I know was learnt that way.

Analogy: Methods in OOP

Think of a microwave oven, you have a button which you can set to different values (parameters). The button safely encapsulates the function/mechanism of warming your food. So you bother less about how the operation is carried out, and concentrate on setting the button right.

Analogy: Private/Public "methods"

(Emphasis on "methods" because I am not simply talking generally about "functions" or subroutines.)
Think of an automatic shift car and a manual shift one. We know that a gear and a clutch can be likened to methods of a "car object" in OOP.

In the manual shift vehicle, you have public access to both the gear and the clutch. However, the automatic shift machine only gives you access to the "gear method", thereby encapsulating the the "clutch method".

#To be Forearmed is to be Help-ready


###We'll Help You if You are Ready


I felt compelled to write this after my personal experience trying to get help with my code on IRC.

We all love to make the computer do things exactly the way we want, so some of us choose to take the bold step of learning to communicate with the machine. And it is not uncommon to find many of our burgeoning kind go from *location to location on the web space* trying to get help along the way. We are prompt to ask questions when we sight help.  
<br/>
>When you learn to program, you are often encouraged to **learn by doing.**
<br/>

The domain of computer programming or software development is a very practical one. Before now, I had carried this very principle everywhere with me -- in fact, preached it -- but hadn't really put it to use.

The thing about learning languages (or technologies) by reading big manuals is that, often times, beginners will approach the process like they would any other literature book. But that is clearly a wrong approach as empirical evidence has shown. You don't read these things to simply stomach them. Instead, you swallow and then post-process. In essence, you ruminate over stuff.

>In truth, the only way you can really process what you read is to **try things out and see results for yourself**.

Weeks ago, while building an app, I visited IRC frequently to ask questions on just about everything that was unclear to me. While this mode of communication and seeking help is encouraged, abuse of it is strongly discouraged. The good guys over on the IRC channels get pissed off when it appears you're boycotting available resources like documentation, preferring to be spoonfed the whole time. (Remember this is not [Quora](http://www.quora.com), where the philosophy is for you to ask more and more questions).

This was the sort of thing that happened to me when I began _flooding_ the channels with my persistent querying. Most of the time the IRC folks kept pointing me to the documentation, as workarounds for most of the issues I had were already documented. A lot of things became much clearer when I decided to finally [read-the-docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

What did I learn from that? __"Do your own research!"__ It's so easy to skip this part, but if you make efforts at finding things out for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much you can dig out without having to bug people. However, this does not guarantee that even the few important questions you'll ask may not be met with hostility, but do not let that discourage you. The people who appear to be unwelcoming are doing so only as a way to discourage you from being over-dependent on the channel.
Another advantage of finding things for yourself is that, you learn the __why__ and not just the __how__.

I think it's fair to quote [Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/) here,

>"And it's not just asking questions; questioning other people, like what other people do or what you do yourself.

>By far, the worst parts in all of my libraries are where I took the design from somewhere else. And it's not because I know better, it's because pretty much everything everybody does at any point in time has some sort of design decision behind it ... that major decision process.

>So someone came up with a solution for a particular problem, and he thought about it and then wrote it down. But if you look at someone else's design, you might no longer understand why the decision was made in the first place. And ... in fact, if the original implementation is ten years old, who knows if the design ideas behind it are still entirely correct."

Personally, I like to answer questions and help put people on track. Nonetheless, if the queries got too overwhelming -- especially coming from the same person -- I would eventually lose interest in answering questions.

<br/>
Let me remind you of some __tidbits or etiquettes of IRC__:

* Construct your questions well (concise, well written and straight-to-the-point questions are more likely to attract help)
  
  
* Don't EVER post code in a channel! [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)__[1]__ it and share the link in the channel instead. While at it, don't post your entire code (unless you specifically need to). Post only the relevant portion -- the one you have an issue with. The only exception to this is if the snippet of code is considerably short, say one or two lines.

  
  
* Don't be overly respectful. Yes, dont be too respectful -- _cut all the 'Sirs'_. Only be moderately polite.
    
  
* Ensure you have and use a registered nick. This gives you an identity.

  
* This last one is entirely my opinion but it's also based on what I have observed. **Don't just be a leech, try to contribute to the community**. Answer questions when you can.

<br/>

So where do you look to before looking to IRC? There are three sources you may __read__ from before turning to internet-relay-chat for help:
  
* __Read the documentation__. * Documentation is the manual the creator or experts of a software product or tool provide their users with. So you want to know the ins and outs of a technology? That's the right place to look.
  
  
* __Read blog posts__ related to your topic-area. Blog posts are often based on people's experiences, so you're likely to find help from there, especially if the writer has faced the same issue. Remember to `bookmark` the really helpful ones as you go ;).
  
  
* Last and very important. __[Read the source code!](http://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/)__. This is two-fold: First is actually looking into your own code carefully and seeing what syntax or semantic errors you might have made. Secondly, you look into the original code of libraries/frameworks you are using if they are open source, otherwise revert to documentation. With this, you have it all stripped to its bare bones. Point blank! The source code reveals everything you need to know, once you know how to read it.

<br/>
So why not arm yourself properly before going to post that question. That way, you would not only make it easier to get help [for yourself], but you would be better informed.

Working with Sublime Text





My work in recent months has been entirely in the Sublime Text environment.

I find it a very simplistic, neat and effective tool, which can also easily become frustrating if you don't manage it well. Therefore I have for you a few tips that can make your general workflow with this tool a smooth ride.

Sublime Text is highly customisable. Firstly: Being JSON-formatted, configuration options can be tweaked pretty easily.

Secondly, the open-source community has birthed a plethora of useful plugins, which in my opinion, just give you wings to fly. I find this particularly interesting because Sublime Text itself is not an open source software, although there have been efforts by developers out there to mock an open sourced version of the application. One major project being, [Lime Text]() -- insteresting name, I know ;).

First off, __use what you need__. Installing so many plugins whilst being limited by hardware is one of the ways to make the software become displeased with you. It begins to throw tantrums. Trust me when I say you don't want to be faster than your text editor or IDE, having it intermittently  interrupt your workflow.

I decided to use the power of Sublime's configurations and came up with a way to truly work distractionless.

Use the following keystrokes to swith between different views more easily:
  -- ALT SHIFT T (Toggle tab visibility)
  -- ALT SHIFT S (Toggle Sidebar visibility)
  -- ALT SHIFT D (Toggle between Distraction-Free mode and normal mode)
  -- ALT SHIFT M (Toggle MenuBar visibility)




Using the distraction-free mode of Sublime has definitely been a plus to my productivity. However, I noticed something weird about this mode. After a couple of saves, the application appears to become frozen. At first I thought this was caused by an incompatible/buggy plugin, but I thought wrong.

My approach to solving the problem was to fire up my terminal and type:
		$ killall sublime_text
This fix did it in a brute force way, so I had to restart the application all the time. However, a few days ago, I noticed the

So tonight I got listening to podcasts as usual. At the time, I was simultaneously doing some laundry.

I listened to about three podcasts: One from BBC Click, another from Startup, and the last from Ted Radio NPR podcast.

BBC Click talked on digital publishing. I would have to listen to that again to write anything on it as I listened to it half-heartedly.

Startup was a bit more enlightening. First a new term : Term Sheet -- which is often used in the context of "a potential investor handing you one". A term sheet is …

That reminds me of another interesting term used in the entrepreneurial domain, which I learnt about sometime ago: "Burnout Capital". Burnout Capital is  …

Also, the Startup podcast pointed out something really important about CEOs. And that is, "You must know your numbers." So you own a company; while that may earn you some bragging rights, you must understand that, you now have a big duty to tracking your metrics. If anyone woke you up in the middle of the [sub for 'night'], you should be able to articulate your projections clearly.

NPR's podcast, although tagged differently, focused on one theme: Compassion. This was the subject that four separately interviewed guests talked about.

On the subject of a name for my new blog, "Volatile Musings" was a good enough option, but something about it didn't feel right. I eventually went through a phases of rather quick name changes before arriving at the current one. I went from "Volatile Musings of Ace Takwas" to "reBLOGitations | ac3Takwas" drawing partial inspiration from [russ cox's site].

reBLOGitations was intended as a pun on regurtitation, but that clearly had an eerie effect. I confess, I did bug the IRC rooms for feedbacks/suggestions on this one. Again, the negative responses prompted a change in the name, and I somehow ingeniously arrived at a somewhat unique naming style: acetakwas.log()

On thing was certain, I did not want my full name to be obscure on the site, and I also wanted some promotion for my longtime alias: takwas or acetakwas.

Now this name uses some JS syntax (for the name), and some Python syntax(for the clever tagline). This was intentional. I want to be seen as a language-agnostic programmer.

I have observed that speaking without keeping track -- there are ways to do this -- when compared to writing is not beneficial. You should talk less and write more.

When you write, you can go back over what you've written as many times as possible. You can edit the content, before publishing, if you do. In contrast, you don't get these benefits with writing, except you record your speech and edit before playing before an audience. But this is of course, not very practiceable.

I have known Git for about three years, but something as simple as Git didn't begin to make actual sense to me until sometime in July this year when I was determined to actually learn and **use** it. I started using Git to version control my team's project.

I also tried to understand it well enough to be able to not only persuade my co-developer colleague/teammate to use the tool, but to also teach it to him in as simplified an approach as I could muscle up.

This is why I have become fond of telling people to stop learning for learning, but for usage. Are you thinking of learning a new programming language? If yes, then why not a take a moment and ask yourself a few questions. What would you do with this new skill? How does this new learning improve your work, life or activities. If you are unable to find answers to these wuestions, then you proobably wouldn't enjoy the learning experience and you most likely wouldn't keep your interest alive for long.

So on with the subject of a year end resolution.

I decided to become more quiet. Goodness me, I just read a Quora answer that says, " you hear more when there's less noise." Needless to say, you hear more from within yourself, when you make less noise yourself.

That's part of what got me finally started on this blog. And I'm glad I'm able to do one or two writings more frequently.

I'm really hungry foe productivity, and I'm prepared to shed all unhelpful habits. I

The Year End Resolution that Near-Failed.

Now, while it's become almost cliched that a lot of folks would make resolutions at the inceptions of new seasons, I have done something that appears to be in stark contrast to what seems to be conventional.

My year-end resolution was to become more taciturn than ever. Now, while I could boldly say I made some progress at the initial stage, it clearly wasn't going to continue that way.

As days came in upon days, I started loosening my grip on this new decision. I became increasigly enthusiastic about my conversations, since they were often centered upon topics that resonate on technology.

It's almost a new year, and I am bent on makeing this one a reality. I will confess it won't be a smooth ride, but I hope to get through with it.

Slack is very Configurable

How I reset our Slack channels.

Slack has paid and free versions, but the free one already comes with a ton of cool features, and is highly usable as is, especially for teams that are very small like mine. So we have stuck with this unpaid version of the application for a few months.

Recently, we decided to have our clients join our slack team. This has some benefits:
    - It would help us keep the client up-to-date on project progress
    - It brings our clients to our preferred communication platform (So we have them all in one place)


In doing this, we were presented with a small challenge. All our previous discussions had mostly being in the single, public, general channel. Some of these discussions obviously included stuff we would rather keep private. Even though the first client, had already signed up, I had to quicjly find a way to migrate -- I chose not to delete -- the messages in the hope that he had not scrolled back through the message log.

Upon doing a quick surf around the Slack options, I discovered I could

# A Peek into Blueprints in Flask

I know there are many useful tutorials that explain the concept of Blueprints in Flask, but I have decided to enlist another to the [sub for 'long list' avalanche] of resources already available.


##First, why Blueprints?

The Flask documentation says [somethings]() about Blueprints and why they are useful. I would like to highlight on one point from that page:

> Provide template filters, static files, templates, and other utilities through blueprints. A blueprint does not have to implement applications or view functions.


Using Blueprints just gives a straightforward way to think of structuring your application in terms of modules, although you are not limited to blueprints' modules alones; your app can of course contain other modules as you wish.

I started looking for common patterns among blueprints, and I discovered that, a Blueprint can have among other things it's own set of view functions, with an optional URL prefix (configured using the `url_refix` parameter in the instantiation of a new Blueprint object).


The simplest way to illustrate this in my opinion, is with the exanple of a web application that has different levels of users: regular users, moderators and administrators.
