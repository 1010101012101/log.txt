There is a contest
My mind is the ring
The fighters are my interests
This whole play camouflaged as thinking

Soon there'll be a conquest
Then I can feel relieved
A question stands out though
What are they all fighting for?

The answer is subtle
The medal is golden
They are gunning for Time
It's all going on in my mind

My mind is akin to a Unix server
I have different talents and hobbies
These are my users
I will have to implement Time Sharing

My mind is a hangar
Ideas taxing in and out
Eureka is a banger
My breath times-out

My mind is a race track
My thoughts, the runners
The winners, my acts
Question is: who are the loosers?

My mind is yet another puzzle
Waiting to be solved
But will it ever be unriddled
The mystery that sits atop of it all

Change is constant
Time is variant

"So I answer her question one more time hoping it would be the last of what seemed to be a hundred times already. I honestly couldn't place this question quite rightly. Was it meant to be rhetoric? No, that would mean I didn't need to give a response, which would be rude, given our strong hold on cultural values."

"It can't be! It laid there only a minute ago. Wait a minute," he said, as he swiftly made for the door, ducking-out his head first and holding on to either side of the wooden frame with each hand. "He must have gone this way," his head now turned leftwards. At first he intended to follow his instincts and go right after the unknown man whom had just eloped with his phone, he quickly realised that this was a lost battle. His head plummeted, facing the floor, but still held back by his neck which was now hanging on to his collar bone.

I am a Painter; I paint with words
My tongue is the painting brush
My voice, the ink
My statements, the pieces

But for your listening minds
I would have no canvas
Because these words would just die as they are birthed
Now I can step back to behold a finished work of art


I am so many things
Actually I want to be so many things
Even a killer
So I can kill my evil thoughts

I want to be a…

I have seen that before. Yes. This is not the first and I can bet it would take an unprecedented kind of miracle to make that even the penultimate.

What bothers me now is that you seem bothered.
Why, shouldn't I be?
Hey, you can take this with a grain of salt; but my sincerest opinion: you shouldn't. This has literally become music to our ears.
So what, shall I dance to it's sordid tune?

You know sarcasm is like salt: put little more than needed in your broth and … you know the rest.

With the current situation of the country, and of course the upcoming primaries, no one should be surprised if an explosion rocked his garage. What can we do? Aren't we merely rookies, with the big players up there running the show to favor their pot-bellies?

I bet all we can do now is to pray our heads do not get served up next while one of them makes his move on the other.

I couldn't agree more. It's all a game; and you know the thing about games? Not only are there winners and loosers, there are unfortunately, casualties. If you get lucky to be POW, then there is that glimpse of hope.

Let's get our behinds out of here as quickly as possible. The feds are going to be sweeping the whole place before you know it. They always get in on the action; only ever late.

After you, please.

I have the feeling that my emotions are wrapped up in the world of whatever book I'm reading at an instant.

Talking EPL: From a Gunner's perspective

You can take a peek at the league table at the moment and be sure to pull a wide grin. One can't help the sensation that some ray of hope looms as current standings show that a mere four (4) points seperates us from the 'top spotters'.

That glimmer may be quickly dashed out the window though once you become aware of the fact that the league leaders are currently still two games short. Add-in their resilient spirit as we've seen them display and you could ignore the fact that in the remaining eight matches lie a potential 24 points that could transcend the fate of our North London side. 

Even though I would want for the team to keep up her winning streak till finish. I must admit, in accordance with reality, and you'll agree with me that that is highly unlikely to be the turn of events.

Want my take? I say we have a potential for the penultimate spot, so we should gun for that instead, even though it's almost becoming second nature for the team to finish off with runner-up honours. Howbeit, who says there's a crime in eyeing the golden top spot? We can only hope that the present occupants would somehow trip, relinquishing their title to us.

As for the 'City' in front of us, we'll leave them to tangle with their 'derby neighbours' who have trailed us as proximately as possible.

Let's just hope they don't 'get United' (no pun intended) for obvious reasons … ;)


Happy Sunday fellas!

I gitbox it

I find it handy to keep a lot of stuffs in text files for easy offline reference. From my most  frequently used commands to the short notes I take while learning new things. Configuration settings that I might or might not be able to reuse. You know, these things can take long to tweak at times, so having them saved for reuse can be a tad useful.

For those who use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, you may not find this to be of much use to you. However, if like me, you use a Linux box and have difficulties setting up a cloud backup service, then you can  take a seat, relax and learn how to use git to get your own git-based sync service running.

Create a folder on your computer to hold the files you wish to backup. Ensure to give it a proper name as this would be name for your git repository when set up.

To begin, navigate to the folder above in your terminal and type "git init". To see the curent status of your git repository, type "git status".

To begin adding files for tracking, type "git add ." followed by "git commit". Your default text editor would immediately launch and you can type some message to indicate that this is your first commit.

To ease things up a bit, I have decided to use my programming prowess to create a tool to streamline this process. The caveat to beware of is that this setup is best suited for managing text-files.

In my usual wandering around the web, I stumbled upon a tool that makes the process of file conflicts resolution seem like sugar. This tool goes by the name "Meld". And guess what, it's written in Python. No joke: since discovering this tool, I have anticipated more and more merge conflicts in dealing with version controlling. It's just such a neat process to be able to look at two or three more files that are paradoxically both similar and dissimilar and be able to sync their contents by hand so fluidly.

My interview (stage 1)



Mr Ben walked in as always and joked about my incessant use of the Linux operating system playfully calling me "the Linux man". I playfully retorted saying, "You guys jad better employed me and let me teach Linux and Android Development".

Even though I had said that without expecting to be taken serious, I was taken by surprise when he asked me to send him my CV immediately.

I did send the curriculum vitae but not until almost a week afterwards after his incessant calls for me to do so. Lo I received a call from the headquarters informing me of a scheduled interview two days from the time.

Thursday the 3rd of September, there I was sitting amongst 4 other applicants whom I had assessed as being better edged than myself viz-a-viz paper qualifications.

Stop following this blog!
--------------------------


Uhmm.. I think you read that right, and I did not write this post while sleepwalking. In fact, I have been awake a long time and I am not quite sleepy as yet.

Without any doubt, I have not been the most dedicated blogger. I agree I started out with so much enthusiasm. But you know that happens to a lot of us when we make new resolutions; we often follow our resolutions with persistence. Only sadly enough, that persistence is often shortlived.

It's been months since my procrastination had sprung forth, again! Yes, I was that enthusiastic blogger at the beginning who had so much plans for "things (writings) to come up". I had envisaged a good and enjoyable writing journey. Apparently, that hasn't quite been the state of things. However, I believe I'm back, except that this time I'll be honest and not promise any form of consistency. You see, I still hold that dream of a good writing course; so in the meantime, I will simply endeavour to keep up with updating this blog.

Now, while I don't want to bug you with the Quora notifications of my sporadic blog posts -- and trust me here, I know the feeling: I too hate it when I get those annoying buzzers -- I am asking you to chill out a while. Let me get the blog to some state of fairly consistent posts. I am doing this with the hope that when I do ask you to return to "reading me", you would be kind enough to accept my humble invitation. However, I am not compelling you to do this. It's just that I think it would be in your best interest if you don't like getting post notifications from a staggering blogger/writer like myself.

This is how I plan to bounce back and I hope you understand my rationale. Of course, I am open to suggestions or ideas from you my readers (you still are, even after you may leave; plus the URL has not changed).

Overall, my aim is to overcome procrastination, but I also know it won't come easy. Everyday activities: school, work, church, working on personal projects, family and commuting, for me, are the usual competitors for my time. I have yet to come up with a strategy to qualitatively manage my time. So if you have any suggestions on that as well, kindly drop them in the comment box that lives just below here.

I'm in a vehicle travelling to Ilishan Remo where my sister's school is situated.

A couple of thoughts running through my mind and I'm doing my usual pondering.

One question I'm pondering on now is why some people would feign reluctance to use some technology and over time covertly subscribe to use same. I mean, why hate the tech in the first place?

On a different  note,  I see myself tending towards a disciplinary charisma. I am especially strict with people in my own circle (worthy of mention would be my sister), sometimes even with some not-so-close people.

Thinking about leadership, I feel the first task every "boss" should embark upon should be that of building a ladder that connects his high horse to his followers. I cannot overemphasise the importance of building a close warm relationship with the people you lead.

Can we have more ways to indulge our uneducated youths? I think while we seek how we can provide employments for the educated populace, we should also put their uneducated counterparts in "gainful busyness". This would drastically reduce crime rates in my opinion.

The syntax for Markdown is something I started looking at (again) last night, having looked at it sometime ago. It's really easy to learn, especially when compared with HTML. I feel every programmer who might want to learn to write its syntax should make it their constant way of writing any plain text notes. It doesn't really get in the way of the content, so reading won't be a hassle.

I will try to find out how markdown differs from rst.

With Great COMMITments
---------------------------

These two articles [links below*] are definitely worth your time if you are looking to learn some good habits. Asides their evangelism of good practices, they have both helped me appreciate the usefulness of such a powerful tool, another geeky contribution of our genius Linus Torvalds. This tool, which is described in her official Man Pages as "the stupid content tracker" is Git. Git is a collaborative development tool -- there is a technical jargon: "Distributed Version Control System" -- and as such should be used with others (team members or collaborators) in mind.

* Here are the links:
	- Delibrate Git - http://rakeroutes.com/blog/deliberate-git/
	- How to Write a Git Commit Message - http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit


Perhaps you haven't heard of Git or do not know its purpose. So I'll put it simply: Git is useful for at least two things:

    Multiple people working on the same project can make changes to the same file or set of files at the same time without necessarily messing up another person's changes.
    You have a long -- very long -- fully detailed history (log) of all your file changes.



Now, these are things I don't see you doing manually without getting easily frustrated.

I am not going to try to re-write what these awesome guys have taking the pain (or joy if you'd like) to blog about. That's why I shared the links up there. Go soak up the information for yourself.

As with any standard tool, there are standard guidelines for the use of Git. However, some of these rules are often not hard-and-fast rules that you have to follow religiously. You can sometimes bend things, but not without motive. In those posts (mentioned above), the authors offer guides that have worked for them over time but you are not under compulsion to strictly observe any of them. In my opinion, what counts is your consistency and your rationale for choosing whatever style guides you decide to go with. In essence, do things to be productive and avoid getting in the way of others, even yourself. Stick with doing things in a way that is easily communicable within your team.

It is often the case, as I've found that people just want to get things done in a hurry and see the outcome of their work. While, that is not entirely a bad thing to do, the subtle things you fail to do at times could come hunt you with the course of time. So that one-liner comment you were too lazy to write while coding up your brand new application, may just be the one to get you back on track when someone revisits that section of your code later. Bear in mind that that 'someone' could very well be you.

Honestly, in the Git world, I am still very much a newbie. Even though I've known about this tool for quite some time, I haven't been actively using it. This is largely because prior to this moment, I always found Git concepts difficult to wrap my mind around -- I've seen many people say the same thing online. But I've kept coming back to it and I think I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, for one thing, I'm glad I'm learning these good practices early on. It's a well known fact that unlearning is a lot more of a difficult task than learning the bad habits in the first instance.

This is not some technical prose, so I won't be given any git howtos or typing some code here. The important point to draw from here is that:

    "with great commits come great commitments" 


Any regular Git user would understand and agree with that.

Git has its good parts and evils, but because it's just a stupid innocent tool, I'm going to be both kind and moderate here. I won't go on waxing lyrical about the good parts, and I won't even discuss the bad habits that Git obstinately refused to drop despite mama's appeals.

Within the last two weeks, I have created several repositories within my Linux machine. For some of them, I have setup remote repositories on the social source code hosting site called Github[1] -- that is arguably the most popular website when you speak about open source development. I like the ease of use of Github. They provide good tutorials too. But, for my team's projects, which are not yet fit for public consumption, I will stick with Bitbucket which offers me free private repositories.

Raised with a silver spoon

Although born in one of the most awkward ways known to man, Mark's birth wasn't a totally strange one. His mnother had been squatting on a pit laterine when providence had it that he had reached his destination after a rather long journey of nine months. Yes he had gotten to his destination, but his timimg was awfully near-fatal as he only managed to stay atop the laterine by the help of his slightly big head, which held him back from falling with the rest of his mother's faeces.

Life definitely had more surprises for this creature as he wasn't going be greeted with a warm life afterall.

What Project are you working on?
-------------------------------------------

Should you do a side project? Absolutely! That has to be a no brainer, right?

It's the one question I have seen asked over and over again by potential employees/partners/ angel investors. You see, no one really cares about what you can do. What speaks volumes for you is what you have taken the pain to do.

If you're a startup, investors are not necessarily concerned about your viability -- even though they are to some extent. What matters the more is how your successes have level up against your failures -- yes failures do count as well, because that gives them a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of your business.

It's the same game that plays out in an interview room. As a developer, when people speak of experience, you shouldn't narrow your scope to just experience gotten from paid jobs. It is more important that you focus on how many challenges you have faced  [and overcome], and what lessons you've brought back home.

Take on frequent side projects -- it doesn't matter how big the project idea is, but try to see it to completion.

Points towards my forthcoming presentation at NIIT
-------------------------------------------------------

At the TECH+ event which I attended recently, one of the panelists pointed out that there are sectors such as AGRICULTURE and TRANSPORTATION which could benefit from technology (apps in this case) that have yet to be tapped into. I consciously registered this comment.

I like to think that "data is gold". Google uses crowdsourced information to improve her map software. In like manner, we have decided upon using surveys through Google forms to get people to submit the needed data for this app. Afterall, what would be the point in creating this app if there was no data to work upon.

This project is still in its first phase. We will improve upon it, and get it much closer to the users by putting the app on their smartphones.

Have we used an optimized algorithm versus an approach based on exhaustive enumeration?

I saw an incompleteness im the Google map and a need for the man.

How often do you turn on data?

Yesterday, I had a prototypical pitch of AFraisr at a prototypical MMS competition.

Well, the preparations had been going on for months, but the real event took place yesterday.

In what would be a rather disappointing decision on my path, I pre-released the app to a miniature audience. In truth, this wasn't a move I made unreluctantly. In fact, I made the decision at the VERY LAST MINUTE.

I had made some progress to the router app I was working on -- I'm still working on it -- but, carelessly failed to git-commit at certain important stages. That may not have been the main issue. Something of more importance was the fact that I had a poor GUI.

My attempts to fix this resulted in uncontrollable/unresolveable bugs at the time. This ultimately led me to one saving grace: prematurely pitching AFraisr.

Well, that ends the sordid bit of the tale. The good part begins with the fact that the presentation went better than I had expected even though I had obscured some parts of the app from the intrigued audience. What followed was a series of questions that indicated the "noobness" of the audience to the concept of crowdfunding or even a crowdfunding platform.

Having done the pitch without consent from the rest of my team, I was now under the onus to apologise for my actions, which I consequently did.

That part went well as well. But "what comes afterwards?" becomes the big question. AFraisr has taken its first peep into the world. How would it be treated by a much broader audience? In about a month from now which is the prototype launch time-goal we have set for ourselves, we might get a peek into the answers to these questions.

In other events of the day, a face-off that was supposed to be the main activity for the day saw the SE students lock horns with NE students. The result? Obvious: the software guys were trumping. Truth be told though, it was an unevenly matched set of participants.


================#####=================

I felt inclined to write this after [name here] sent me a Quora A2A on this question.  

I'll paraphrase the query as "How do you go from novice to maestro on the computer?"

Actually, I can't tell you that because I'm have yet to attain become a master myself. However, I can share my experience with you.

I started out like every other person, a complete noob! In my opinion though, everyone is a noob at one thing or at one time or the other. The question I ask is, can one ever stop being noob? The simple answer is "no". I find myself being new at unfamiliar technology from time to time. Just over a few weeks ago, I was burgeoning user of a popular version control system, Git. When I joke about that now I say I have become ...; now living on "branches", frequently hopping from one to the other. After having used Git to manage my team's codebase for a while, I can't quite say the same for myself again. Who knows what technology I'll have to learn tomorrow: I know quite a few of them already.

Intuitiveness is a powerful skill to posess. I say 'skill' because, I find it is surprisingly lacking in a lot of IT users that I encounter. Some people, as a result of fear, fail to try out any hunches; worse yet, some do not even bother to think of possible workarounds for any technical issue they are faced with. On the technical side: of course, I do not expect you to go around fixing technical hitch if you lack the necessary expertise, notwithstanding, you are not debarred from one or two troubleshootings.

A very common habit with many IT end-users is that of "wanting your hands to be held while you walk along". Some folks would even prefer to have someone turn on their computers for them. During a conversation with an acquaintance a few weeks ago -- a guy named Emeka (works at the Lagos Business School) -- Emeka told me of an experience where a client came complaining of a "not-working" computer. When he got to the PC in question, he found out that the power cable had been disconnected. Funny enough, the lady knew this, but had failed to simply connect the cable for fear of an electric shock. How pathetic can people be?

So you think you want to be good with computers? Then you must first take off your garment of fear, and come in to taking daring things. In IT, you must be ready to tinker with a lot of things. A bulk of what I know was learnt that way.

Analogy: Methods in OOP

Think of a microwave oven, you have a button which you can set to different values (parameters). The button safely encapsulates the function/mechanism of warming your food. So you bother less about how the operation is carried out, and concentrate on setting the button right.


================#####=================
Analogy: Private/Public "methods"

(Emphasis on "methods" because I am not simply talking generally about "functions" or subroutines.)
Think of an automatic shift car and a manual shift one. We know that a gear and a clutch can be likened to methods of a "car object" in OOP.

In the manual shift vehicle, you have public access to both the gear and the clutch. However, the automatic shift machine only gives you access to the "gear method", thereby encapsulating the the "clutch method".

Using the distraction-free mode of Sublime has definitely been a plus to my productivity. However, I noticed something weird about this mode. After a couple of saves, the application appears to become frozen. At first I thought this was caused by an incompatible/buggy plugin, but I thought wrong.

My approach to solving the problem was to fire up my terminal and type:
		$ killall sublime_text
This fix did it in a brute force way, so I had to restart the application all the time. However, a few days ago, I noticed the 


================#####=================

Practice.
Compelled to write this after the experience I've had in the last few days. When you learn to program, you often come across statements that encourage you to "learn by doing".

Programming is a very practical field. Up until now, I had carried this principle everywhere with me -- in fact, preached it -- but hadn't really made effective use of it.

The thing about learning languages (or technologies) by reading big manuals is that often times, beginners will approach the process like they would any other literature book. But that is clearly a wrong approach as empirical evidence points out. You don't read this things to simply stomach them. Instead, you swallow and then post-process. In essence, you ruminate over stuff.

So how is this related to the topic of this piece, you may ask. In truth, the only way you can really process what you read is to try things out and see results for yourself.

In the previous week, while building an app, I visited IRC frequently to ask questions about just about everything that was unclear to me. While this is good to an extent, getting in the habit of this would eventually piss off the good people in those channels. This was the sort of thing that happened to me.

What did I learn from that? Do your own research. It's so easy to skip this part, but if you make efforts at finding things out for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much you can dig out without having to bug people. This does not mean that even the few important questions you'll ask may not be met with hostility. Do jot let this discourage you. The people who appear to be unwelcoming are doing so only as a way to discourage you from being over dependent on the channel.

Personally, I like to answer questions and help put people on track. Nonetheless, if the queries get to overwhelming -- especially coming from the same person -- one will eventually lose interest in answering questions.

Let me remind you of some tidbits / etiquettes of IRC:
  -- Construct your questions well (concise, well written and straight-to-the-point questions are more likely to attract help)

  -- Don't be too respectful. Yes, dont be too respectful -- cut all the 'Sirs' -- only be moderately polite. I know this seems like a lot to translate, but you'll figure it out.

-- Don't post code in a channel. <Pastebin> it and share the link in the channel instead. While at it, don't post your entire code (unless you specifically need to). Post only the relevant portion -- the one you have an issue with.

-- This is entirely my opinion but it's also based on what I have observed. Don't just be a [word here] , try to contribute to the community. Give answers to some simple questions others would ask. While at it, ensure you have and use a registered nick. This gives you an identity.

-- 

Read the documentation. Yes, this seems like a lot of work, but it's often easily overlooked how much you can truly understand by doing this. It's one of those things that I got tangled with in the previous week myself.

The IRC folks kept referring me to the docs as there almost always already exists an explanation for what you might be facing.

Then it's also good to read the "source". This cannot be overemphasised. When something is open sourced, it's not done just for fun.



Working with Sublime Text

My work in recent in months has been entirely in the Sublime Text environment.

I find it a very neat tool, which can also easily become frustrating if you don't manage it well. Therefore I have a gew tips that I think can make your general workflow with this tool a smooth ride.

Sublime Text is highly customisable. You can make a lot of configuration changes -- JSON style, and you can download a ton of useful plugins (thanks to the Open Source community that surrounds it. So this is a particularly interesting point given that Sublime Text itself is not an open source although there have been efforts by devs out there  to mock the application. I know of Lime Text.

First off, use only the plugins you truly use. Installing so many plugins whilst being limited by hardware is one of the ways to make the software become displeased with you. It begins to throw tantrums.

Having so many of these installed could easily make it begin to lag and you don't want anything interrupting your workflow.

I decided to use the power of Sublime's configurations and came up with a way to truly work distractionless.
