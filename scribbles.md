There is a contest
My mind is the ring
The fighters are my interests
This whole play camouflaged as thinking

Soon there'll be a conquest
Then I can feel relieved
A question stands out though
What are they all fighting for?

The answer is subtle
The medal is golden
They are gunning for Time
It's all going on in my mind

My mind is akin to a Unix server
I have different talents and hobbies
These are my users
I will have to implement Time Sharing

My mind is a hangar
Ideas taxing in and out
Eureka is a banger
My breath times-out

My mind is a race track
My thoughts, the runners
The winners, my acts
Question is: who are the loosers?

My mind is yet another puzzle
Waiting to be solved
But will it ever be unriddled
The mystery that sits atop of it all

Change is constant
Time is variant
Seasons come and go

Change is not new

"So I answer her question one more time hoping it would be the last of what seemed to be a hundred times already. I honestly couldn't place this question quite rightly. Was it meant to be rhetoric? No, that would mean I didn't need to give a response, which would be rude, given our strong hold on cultural values."

"It can't be! It laid there only a minute ago. Wait a minute," he said, as he swiftly made for the door, ducking-out his head first and holding on to either side of the wooden frame with each hand. "He must have gone this way," his head now turned leftwards. At first he intended to follow his instincts and go right after the unknown man whom had just eloped with his phone, he quickly realised that this was a lost battle. His head plummeted, facing the floor, but still held back by his neck which was now hanging on to his collar bone.

I am a Painter; I paint with words
My tongue is the painting brush
My voice, the ink
My statements, the pieces

But for your listening minds
I would have no canvas
Because these words would just die as they are birthed
Now I can step back to behold a finished work of art


I am so many things
Actually I want to be so many things
Even a killer
So I can kill my evil thoughts

I want to be a…

I have seen that before. Yes. This is not the first and I can bet it would take an unprecedented kind of miracle to make that even the penultimate.

What bothers me now is that you seem bothered.
Why, shouldn't I be?
Hey, you can take this with a grain of salt; but my sincerest opinion: you shouldn't. This has literally become music to our ears.
So what, shall I dance to it's sordid tune?

You know sarcasm is like salt: put little more than needed in your broth and … you know the rest.

With the current situation of the country, and of course the upcoming primaries, no one should be surprised if an explosion rocked his garage. What can we do? Aren't we merely rookies, with the big players up there running the show to favor their pot-bellies?

I bet all we can do now is to pray our heads do not get served up next while one of them makes his move on the other.

I couldn't agree more. It's all a game; and you know the thing about games? Not only are there winners and loosers, there are unfortunately, casualties. If you get lucky to be POW, then there is that glimpse of hope.

Let's get our behinds out of here as quickly as possible. The feds are going to be sweeping the whole place before you know it. They always get in on the action; only ever late.

I have the feeling that my emotions are wrapped up in the world of whatever book I'm reading at an instant.

There are voices in my head screaming for emancipation; the result? I am itching to get a lot more scribbling done.
I feel like I own these pieces that want to be free, but they need my help.

From reading people's works
Or from hearing people talk

Talking EPL: From a Gunner's perspective

You can take a peek at the league table at the moment and be sure to pull a wide grin. One can't help the sensation that some ray of hope looms as current standings show that a mere four (4) points seperates us from the 'top spotters'.

That glimmer may be quickly dashed out the window though once you become aware of the fact that the league leaders are currently still two games short. Add-in their resilient spirit as we've seen them display and you could ignore the fact that in the remaining eight matches lie a potential 24 points that could transcend the fate of our North London side. 

Even though I would want for the team to keep up her winning streak till finish. I must admit, in accordance with reality, and you'll agree with me that that is highly unlikely to be the turn of events.

Want my take? I say we have a potential for the penultimate spot, so we should gun for that instead, even though it's almost becoming second nature for the team to finish off with runner-up honours. Howbeit, who says there's a crime in eyeing the golden top spot? We can only hope that the present occupants would somehow trip, relinquishing their title to us.

As for the 'City' in front of us, we'll leave them to tangle with their 'derby neighbours' who have trailed us as proximately as possible.

Let's just hope they don't 'get United' (no pun intended) for obvious reasons … ;)


Happy Sunday fellas!

I gitbox it

I find it handy to keep a lot of stuffs in text files for easy offline reference. From my most  frequently used commands to the short notes I take while learning new things. Configuration settings that I might or might not be able to reuse. You know, these things can take long to tweak at times, so having them saved for reuse can be a tad useful.

For those who use cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, you may not find this to be of much use to you. However, if like me, you use a Linux box and have difficulties setting up a cloud backup service, then you can  take a seat, relax and learn how to use git to get your own git-based sync service running.

Create a folder on your computer to hold the files you wish to backup. Ensure to give it a proper name as this would be name for your git repository when set up.

To begin, navigate to the folder above in your terminal and type "git init". To see the curent status of your git repository, type "git status".

To begin adding files for tracking, type "git add ." followed by "git commit". Your default text editor would immediately launch and you can type some message to indicate that this is your first commit.

To ease things up a bit, I have decided to use my programming prowess to create a tool to streamline this process. The caveat to beware of is that this setup is best suited for managing text-files.

In my usual wandering around the web, I stumbled upon a tool that makes the process of file conflicts resolution seem like sugar. This tool goes by the name "Meld". And guess what, it's written in Python. No joke: since discovering this tool, I have anticipated more and more merge conflicts in dealing with version controlling. It's just such a neat process to be able to look at two or three more files that are paradoxically both similar and dissimilar and be able to sync their contents by hand so fluidly.

My interview (stage 1)



Mr Ben walked in as always and joked about my incessant use of the Linux operating system playfully calling me "the Linux man". I playfully retorted saying, "You guys jad better employed me and let me teach Linux and Android Development".

Even though I had said that without expecting to be taken serious, I was taken by surprise when he asked me to send him my CV immediately.

I did send the curriculum vitae but not until almost a week afterwards after his incessant calls for me to do so. Lo I received a call from the headquarters informing me of a scheduled interview two days from the time.

Thursday the 3rd of September, there I was sitting amongst 4 other applicants whom I had assessed as being better edged than myself viz-a-viz paper qualifications.

Stop following this blog!
--------------------------


Uhmm.. I think you read that right, and I did not write this post while sleepwalking. In fact, I have been awake a long time and I am not quite sleepy as yet.

Without any doubt, I have not been the most dedicated blogger. I agree I started out with so much enthusiasm. But you know that happens to a lot of us when we make new resolutions; we often follow our resolutions with persistence. Only sadly enough, that persistence is often shortlived.

It's been months since my procrastination had sprung forth, again! Yes, I was that enthusiastic blogger at the beginning who had so much plans for "things (writings) to come up". I had envisaged a good and enjoyable writing journey. Apparently, that hasn't quite been the state of things. However, I believe I'm back, except that this time I'll be honest and not promise any form of consistency. You see, I still hold that dream of a good writing course; so in the meantime, I will simply endeavour to keep up with updating this blog.

Now, while I don't want to bug you with the Quora notifications of my sporadic blog posts -- and trust me here, I know the feeling: I too hate it when I get those annoying buzzers -- I am asking you to chill out a while. Let me get the blog to some state of fairly consistent posts. I am doing this with the hope that when I do ask you to return to "reading me", you would be kind enough to accept my humble invitation. However, I am not compelling you to do this. It's just that I think it would be in your best interest if you don't like getting post notifications from a staggering blogger/writer like myself.

This is how I plan to bounce back and I hope you understand my rationale. Of course, I am open to suggestions or ideas from you my readers (you still are, even after you may leave; plus the URL has not changed).

Overall, my aim is to overcome procrastination, but I also know it won't come easy. Everyday activities: school, work, church, working on personal projects, family and commuting, for me, are the usual competitors for my time. I have yet to come up with a strategy to qualitatively manage my time. So if you have any suggestions on that as well, kindly drop them in the comment box that lives just below here.

I'm in a vehicle travelling to Ilishan Remo where my sister's school is situated.

A couple of thoughts running through my mind and I'm doing my usual pondering.

One question I'm pondering on now is why some people would feign reluctance to use some technology and over time covertly subscribe to use same. I mean, why hate the tech in the first place?

On a different  note,  I see myself tending towards a disciplinary charisma. I am especially strict with people in my own circle (worthy of mention would be my sister), sometimes even with some not-so-close people.

Thinking about leadership, I feel the first task every "boss" should embark upon should be that of building a ladder that connects his high horse to his followers. I cannot overemphasise the importance of building a close warm relationship with the people you lead.

Can we have more ways to indulge our uneducated youths? I think while we seek how we can provide employments for the educated populace, we should also put their uneducated counterparts in "gainful busyness". This would drastically reduce crime rates in my opinion.

# The Developer Arsenal

Every programmer should possess certain skills. These skills are language-agnostic.

- GIT
- Markdown
- RST
- SSH
- FTP
- Bash (or some other shell)


Keep a history of your workflow with __Git__.

The syntax for Markdown is something I started looking at (again) last night, having looked at it sometime ago. It's really easy to learn, especially when compared with HTML. I feel every programmer who might want to learn to write its syntax should make it their constant way of writing any plain text notes. It doesn't really get in the way of the content, so reading won't be a hassle.

I will try to find out how markdown differs from rst.

With Great COMMITments
---------------------------

These two articles [links below*] are definitely worth your time if you are looking to learn some good habits. Asides their evangelism of good practices, they have both helped me appreciate the usefulness of such a powerful tool, another geeky contribution of our genius Linus Torvalds. This tool, which is described in her official Man Pages as "the stupid content tracker" is Git. Git is a collaborative development tool -- there is a technical jargon: "Distributed Version Control System" -- and as such should be used with others (team members or collaborators) in mind.

* Here are the links:
	- Delibrate Git - http://rakeroutes.com/blog/deliberate-git/
	- How to Write a Git Commit Message - http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit


Perhaps you haven't heard of Git or do not know its purpose. So I'll put it simply: Git is useful for at least two things:

    Multiple people working on the same project can make changes to the same file or set of files at the same time without necessarily messing up another person's changes.
    You have a long -- very long -- fully detailed history (log) of all your file changes.



Now, these are things I don't see you doing manually without getting easily frustrated.

I am not going to try to re-write what these awesome guys have taking the pain (or joy if you'd like) to blog about. That's why I shared the links up there. Go soak up the information for yourself.

As with any standard tool, there are standard guidelines for the use of Git. However, some of these rules are often not hard-and-fast rules that you have to follow religiously. You can sometimes bend things, but not without motive. In those posts (mentioned above), the authors offer guides that have worked for them over time but you are not under compulsion to strictly observe any of them. In my opinion, what counts is your consistency and your rationale for choosing whatever style guides you decide to go with. In essence, do things to be productive and avoid getting in the way of others, even yourself. Stick with doing things in a way that is easily communicable within your team.

It is often the case, as I've found that people just want to get things done in a hurry and see the outcome of their work. While, that is not entirely a bad thing to do, the subtle things you fail to do at times could come hunt you with the course of time. So that one-liner comment you were too lazy to write while coding up your brand new application, may just be the one to get you back on track when someone revisits that section of your code later. Bear in mind that that 'someone' could very well be you.

Honestly, in the Git world, I am still very much a newbie. Even though I've known about this tool for quite some time, I haven't been actively using it. This is largely because prior to this moment, I always found Git concepts difficult to wrap my mind around -- I've seen many people say the same thing online. But I've kept coming back to it and I think I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, for one thing, I'm glad I'm learning these good practices early on. It's a well known fact that unlearning is a lot more of a difficult task than learning the bad habits in the first instance.

This is not some technical prose, so I won't be given any git howtos or typing some code here. The important point to draw from here is that:

    "with great commits come great commitments" 


Any regular Git user would understand and agree with that.

Git has its good parts and evils, but because it's just a stupid innocent tool, I'm going to be both kind and moderate here. I won't go on waxing lyrical about the good parts, and I won't even discuss the bad habits that Git obstinately refused to drop despite mama's appeals.

Within the last two weeks, I have created several repositories within my Linux machine. For some of them, I have setup remote repositories on the social source code hosting site called Github[1] -- that is arguably the most popular website when you speak about open source development. I like the ease of use of Github. They provide good tutorials too. But, for my team's projects, which are not yet fit for public consumption, I will stick with Bitbucket which offers me free private repositories.

Raised with a silver spoon

Although born in one of the most awkward ways known to man, Mark's birth wasn't a totally strange one. His mnother had been squatting on a pit laterine when providence had it that he had reached his destination after a rather long journey of nine months. Yes he had gotten to his destination, but his timimg was awfully near-fatal as he only managed to stay atop the laterine by the help of his slightly big head, which held him back from falling with the rest of his mother's faeces.

Life definitely had more surprises for this creature as he wasn't going be greeted with a warm life afterall.

What Project are you working on?
-------------------------------------------

Should you do a side project? Absolutely! That has to be a no brainer, right?

The topic of this piece is one question I have heard over and over again from all sorts of people: potential employers or investors or partners or even from my own inner voice.

The truth is, no one really cares -- well, maybe a few people do -- about what you can do. As a developer, *your prowess is measured by your demonstrations rather than your potentials*. What speaks volumes for you is what you have taken the pain to do.



Believe it or not, people care about what you have tried. For instance, if you're a startup, investors do not merely limit their concerns to your viability. What carries more weight is how your successes have levelled up against your failures -- indeed, failures do count as well, because that gives them a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of your business/team.

It's the same game that plays out in an interview room. As a developer, when potential employers speak of experience, you shouldn't narrow your scope to just experience gotten from 9 to 5 jobs. You should equally consider your personal projects: on how many challenges you have faced [and possibly overcome], and what lessons you've brought back home.

Scott Hanselman said, "I think if you can't be excited about software then you should find a different job."

You should develop the habit of frequently taking on side projects. Always have something you are working on on the side, outside of your regular routine; it doesn't matter how big or small the project idea may be, but __endeavour to see it to completion__. Completing it is key here. Although I am telling you this, it is worth noting that I have failed at this myself. I do have a few side-projects but because I fail to complete them to at least a _demoable_ stage, I am often unable to showcase any of them when the need arises.

So start working on something today. If it is starting to become cumbersome, find someone to work on it with you. Better yet, open source it! There is a pool of hungry programmers out there, waiting to pounce on the next available interesting project.

Points towards my forthcoming presentation at NIIT
-------------------------------------------------------

At the TECH+ event which I attended recently, one of the panelists pointed out that there are sectors such as AGRICULTURE and TRANSPORTATION which could benefit from technology (apps in this case) that have yet to be tapped into. I consciously registered this comment.

I like to think that "data is gold". Google uses crowdsourced information to improve her map software. In like manner, we have decided upon using surveys through Google forms to get people to submit the needed data for this app. Afterall, what would be the point in creating this app if there was no data to work upon.

This project is still in its first phase. We will improve upon it, and get it much closer to the users by putting the app on their smartphones.

Have we used an optimized algorithm versus an approach based on exhaustive enumeration?

I saw an incompleteness im the Google map and a need for the man.

How often do you turn on data?

Yesterday, I had a prototypical pitch of AFraisr at a prototypical MMS competition.

Well, the preparations had been going on for months, but the real event took place yesterday.

In what would be a rather disappointing decision on my path, I pre-released the app to a miniature audience. In truth, this wasn't a move I made unreluctantly. In fact, I made the decision at the VERY LAST MINUTE.

I had made some progress to the router app I was working on -- I'm still working on it -- but, carelessly failed to git-commit at certain important stages. That may not have been the main issue. Something of more importance was the fact that I had a poor GUI.

My attempts to fix this resulted in uncontrollable/unresolveable bugs at the time. This ultimately led me to one saving grace: prematurely pitching AFraisr.

Well, that ends the sordid bit of the tale. The good part begins with the fact that the presentation went better than I had expected even though I had obscured some parts of the app from the intrigued audience. What followed was a series of questions that indicated the "noobness" of the audience to the concept of crowdfunding or even a crowdfunding platform.

Having done the pitch without consent from the rest of my team, I was now under the onus to apologise for my actions, which I consequently did.

That part went well as well. But "what comes afterwards?" becomes the big question. AFraisr has taken its first peep into the world. How would it be treated by a much broader audience? In about a month from now which is the prototype launch time-goal we have set for ourselves, we might get a peek into the answers to these questions.

In other events of the day, a face-off that was supposed to be the main activity for the day saw the SE students lock horns with NE students. The result? Obvious: the software guys were trumping. Truth be told though, it was an unevenly matched set of participants.


================#####=================


I felt inclined to write this after [name here] sent me a Quora A2A on [this question]().  

I'll paraphrase the query as "How do you go from novice to maestro on the computer?"

Actually, I can't tell you that because I have yet to become a master myself. However, I can share my experience with you.

I started out like every other person, a complete noob! In my opinion though, everyone is a noob at one thing or at one time or the other. The question I ask is, can one ever stop being noob? The simple answer is "no". I find myself being new at unfamiliar technology from time to time. Only a few weeks ago, I was a beginning user of a popular version control system, Git. When I joke about that now I say I have become ...; now living on "branches", frequently hopping from one to the other. After having used Git to manage my team's codebase for a while, I can't quite say the same for myself again. Who knows what technology I'll have to learn tomorrow: I know quite a few of them already.

Intuitiveness is a powerful skill to posess. I say 'skill' because, I find it is surprisingly lacking in a lot of IT users that I encounter. Some people, as a result of fear, fail to try out any hunches; worse yet, some do not even bother to think of possible workarounds for any technical issue they are faced with. Of course, I do not expect you to go around fixing technical hitches if you lack the necessary expertise, notwithstanding, you are not debarred from one or two troubleshooting attempts.

A very common habit with many IT end-users is that of "wanting your hands to be held while you walk along". Some folks would even prefer to have someone turn on their computers for them, no joke. During a conversation with an acquaintance a few weeks ago, Emeka[1] told me of an experience where a client came complaining that her computer had stopped working. When he got to the PC in question, he found out that the power cable had been disconnected. Funny enough, the lady knew this, but had failed to re-connect the cable for fear of an electric shock. How pathetic can people be?

So you think you want to be good with computers? Then you must first take off your garment of fear, become intuitive, and try out your hunches. In IT, you must be ready to tinker with a lot of things. A bulk of what I know was learnt that way.

Analogy: Methods in OOP

Think of a microwave oven, you have a button which you can set to different values (parameters). The button safely encapsulates the function/mechanism of warming your food. So you bother less about how the operation is carried out, and concentrate on setting the button right.

Analogy: Private/Public "methods"

(Emphasis on "methods" because I am not simply talking generally about "functions" or subroutines.)
Think of an automatic shift car and a manual shift one. We know that a gear and a clutch can be likened to methods of a "car object" in OOP.

In the manual shift vehicle, you have public access to both the gear and the clutch. However, the automatic shift machine only gives you access to the "gear method", thereby encapsulating the the "clutch method".

#To be Forearmed is to be Help-ready


###We'll Help You if You are Ready


I felt compelled to write this after my personal experience trying to get help with my code on IRC.

We all love to make the computer do things exactly the way we want, so some of us choose to take the bold step of learning to communicate with the machine. And it is not uncommon to find many of our burgeoning kind go from *location to location on the web space* trying to get help along the way. We are prompt to ask questions when we sight help.  
<br/>
>When you learn to program, you are often encouraged to **learn by doing.**
<br/>

The domain of computer programming or software development is a very practical one. Before now, I had carried this very principle everywhere with me -- in fact, preached it -- but hadn't really put it to use.

The thing about learning languages (or technologies) by reading big manuals is that, often times, beginners will approach the process like they would any other literature book. But that is clearly a wrong approach as empirical evidence has shown. You don't read these things to simply stomach them. Instead, you swallow and then post-process. In essence, you ruminate over stuff.

<br/>
>In truth, the only way you can really process what you read is to **try things out and see results for yourself**.
<br/>

Weeks ago, while building an app, I visited IRC frequently to ask questions on just about everything that was unclear to me. While this mode of communication and seeking help is encouraged, abuse of it is strongly discouraged. The good guys over on the IRC channels get pissed off when it appears you're boycotting available resources like documentation, preferring to be spoonfed the whole time. (Remember this is not [Quora](http://www.quora.com), where the philosophy is for you to ask more and more questions).

This was the sort of thing that happened to me when I began _flooding_ the channels with my persistent querying. Most of the time the IRC folks kept pointing me to the documentation, as workarounds for most of the issues I had were already documented. A lot of things became much clearer when I decided to finally [read-the-docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

What did I learn from that? __"Do your own research!"__ It's so easy to skip this part, but if you make efforts at finding things out for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much you can dig out without having to bug people. However, this does not guarantee that even the few important questions you'll ask may not be met with hostility, but do not let that discourage you. The people who appear to be unwelcoming are doing so only as a way to discourage you from being over-dependent on the channel.
Another advantage of finding things for yourself is that, you learn the __why__ and not just the __how__.

I think it's fair to quote [Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/) here,

>"And it's not just asking questions; questioning other people, like what other people do or what you do yourself.

>By far, the worst parts in all of my libraries are where I took the design from somewhere else. And it's not because I know better, it's because pretty much everything everybody does at any point in time has some sort of design decision behind it ... that major decision process.

>So someone came up with a solution for a particular problem, and he thought about it and then wrote it down. But if you look at someone else's design, you might no longer understand why the decision was made in the first place. And ... in fact, if the original implementation is ten years old, who knows if the design ideas behind it are still entirely correct."
  
<br/>
Personally, I like to answer questions and help put people on track. Nonetheless, if the queries got too overwhelming -- especially coming from the same person -- I would eventually lose interest in answering questions.

<br/>
Let me remind you of some __tidbits or etiquettes of IRC__:

* Construct your questions well (concise, well written and straight-to-the-point questions are more likely to attract help)
  
  
* Don't EVER post code in a channel! [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin)__[1]__ it and share the link in the channel instead. While at it, don't post your entire code (unless you specifically need to). Post only the relevant portion -- the one you have an issue with. The only exception to this is if the snippet of code is considerably short, say one or two lines.

  
  
* Don't be overly respectful. Yes, dont be too respectful -- _cut all the 'Sirs'_. Only be moderately polite.
    
  
* Ensure you have and use a registered nick. This gives you an identity.

  
* This last one is entirely my opinion but it's also based on what I have observed. **Don't just be a leech, try to contribute to the community**. Answer questions when you can.

<br/>

So where do you look to before looking to IRC? There are three sources you may __read__ from before turning to internet-relay-chat for help:
  
* __Read the documentation__. * Documentation is the manual the creator or experts of a software product or tool provide their users with. So you want to know the ins and outs of a technology? That's the right place to look.
  
  
* __Read blog posts__ related to your topic-area. Blog posts are often based on people's experiences, so you're likely to find help from there, especially if the writer has faced the same issue. Remember to `bookmark` the really helpful ones as you go ;).
  
  
* Last and very important. __[Read the source code!](http://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/)__. This is two-fold: First is actually looking into your own code carefully and seeing what syntax or semantic errors you might have made. Secondly, you look into the original code of libraries/frameworks you are using if they are open source, otherwise revert to documentation. With this, you have it all stripped to its bare bones. Point blank! The source code reveals everything you need to know, once you know how to read it.

<br/>
So why not arm yourself properly before going to post that question. That way, you would not only make it easier to get help [for yourself], but you would be better informed.

Working with Sublime Text





My work in recent months has been entirely in the Sublime Text environment.

I find it a very simplistic, neat and effective tool, which can also easily become frustrating if you don't manage it well. Therefore I have for you a few tips that can make your general workflow with this tool a smooth ride.

Sublime Text is highly customisable. Firstly: Being JSON-formatted, configuration options can be tweaked pretty easily.

Secondly, the open-source community has birthed a plethora of useful plugins, which in my opinion, just give you wings to fly. I find this particularly interesting because Sublime Text itself is not an open source software, although there have been efforts by developers out there to mock an open sourced version of the application. One major project being, [Lime Text]() -- insteresting name, I know ;).

First off, __use what you need__. Installing so many plugins whilst being limited by hardware is one of the ways to make the software become displeased with you. It begins to throw tantrums. Trust me when I say you don't want to be faster than your text editor or IDE, having it intermittently  interrupt your workflow.

I decided to use the power of Sublime's configurations and came up with a way to truly work distractionless.

Use the following keystrokes to swith between different views more easily:
  -- ALT SHIFT T (Toggle tab visibility)
  -- ALT SHIFT S (Toggle Sidebar visibility)
  -- ALT SHIFT D (Toggle between Distraction-Free mode and normal mode)
  -- ALT SHIFT M (Toggle MenuBar visibility)




Using the distraction-free mode of Sublime has definitely been a plus to my productivity. However, I noticed something weird about this mode. After a couple of saves, the application appears to become frozen. At first I thought this was caused by an incompatible/buggy plugin, but I thought wrong.

My approach to solving the problem was to fire up my terminal and type:
		$ killall sublime_text
This fix did it in a brute force way, so I had to restart the application all the time. However, a few days ago, I noticed this was not caused by some bug. Instead it was the modal window of Sublime Text that reminds you pay for the text editor, that had been popping up at thos times, albeit underneath the active window. This was happening because my text editor, while in "distraction-free" mode was going full screen and preventing other applications from taking focus.

In Church


It turns out "abundance" isn't about having more than your neighbour. It's means "having more than you have need for".


================#####=================


So tonight I got listening to podcasts as usual. At the time, I was simultaneously doing some laundry.

I listened to about three podcasts: One from BBC Click, another from Startup, and the last from Ted Radio NPR podcast.

BBC Click talked on digital publishing. I would have to listen to that again to write anything on it as I listened to it half-heartedly.

Startup was a bit more enlightening. First a new term : Term Sheet -- which is often used in the context of "a potential investor handing you one". A term sheet is …

That reminds me of another interesting term used in the entrepreneurial domain, which I learnt about sometime ago: "Burnout Capital". Burnout Capital is  …

Also, the Startup podcast pointed out something really important about CEOs. And that is, "You must know your numbers." So you own a company; while that may earn you some bragging rights, you must understand that, you now have a big duty to tracking your metrics. If anyone woke you up in the middle of the [sub for 'night'], you should be able to articulate your projections clearly.

NPR's podcast, although tagged differently, focused on one theme: Compassion. This was the subject that four separately interviewed guests talked about.

On the subject of a name for my new blog, "Volatile Musings" was a good enough option, but something about it didn't feel right. I eventually went through a phases of rather quick name changes before arriving at the current one. I went from "Volatile Musings of Ace Takwas" to "reBLOGitations | ac3Takwas" drawing partial inspiration from [russ cox's site].

reBLOGitations was intended as a pun on regurtitation, but that clearly had an eerie effect. I confess, I did bug the IRC rooms for feedbacks/suggestions on this one. Again, the negative responses prompted a change in the name, and I somehow ingeniously arrived at a somewhat unique naming style: acetakwas.log()

On thing was certain, I did not want my full name to be obscure on the site, and I also wanted some promotion for my longtime alias: takwas or acetakwas.

Now this name uses some JS syntax (for the name), and some Python syntax(for the clever tagline). This was intentional. I want to be seen as a language-agnostic programmer.



================#####=================


I have observed that speaking without keeping track -- there are ways to do this -- when compared to writing is not beneficial. You should talk less and write more.

When you write, you can go back over what you've written as many times as possible. You can edit the content, before publishing, if you do. In contrast, you don't get these benefits with writing, except you record your speech and edit before playing before an audience. But this is of course, not very practiceable.

I have known Git for about three years, but something as simple as Git didn't begin to make actual sense to me until sometime in July this year when I was determined to actually learn and **use** it. I started using Git to version control my team's project.

I also tried to understand it well enough to be able to not only persuade my co-developer colleague/teammate to use the tool, but to also teach it to him in as simplified an approach as I could muscle up.

This is why I have become fond of telling people to stop learning for learning, but for usage. Are you thinking of learning a new programming language? If yes, then why not a take a moment and ask yourself a few questions. What would you do with this new skill if acquired? How does this new learning improve your work, life or activities. If you are unable to find answers to these wuestions, then you proobably wouldn't enjoy the learning experience and you most likely wouldn't keep your interest alive for long.

The Year End Resolution that Near-Failed.

Now, while it's become almost cliched that a lot of folks would make resolutions at the inceptions of new seasons, I have done something that appears to be in stark contrast to what seems to be conventional.

My year-end resolution was to become more taciturn than ever. Now, while I could boldly say I made some progress at the initial stage, it clearly wasn't going to continue that way.

As days came in upon days, I started loosening my grip on this new decision. I became increasigly enthusiastic about my conversations, since they were often centered upon topics that resonate on technology.

It's almost a new year, and I am bent on making this one a reality. I will confess it won't be a smooth ride, but I hope to get through with it.

Python Goldmines

In seeking to become better with the Python programming language, I have been scouring the web for helpful resources.

At the moment, I am doing most of my work with the Flask web framework, which is used to build the backend of web applications. It is also very commonly used for building REST APIs.

I have found that one of.the ways to be more adept in any programming  language, is by picking one of the _good_ frameworks/libraries built atop of it, and making use of it. You should look specifically at the ones that are open source, so you can peek at their source code too.

And this is very much the case with Flask and Python.

While taking the learn-as-you-build approach, I find myself constantly refactoring code as I learn better ways to do things. I am often cross-learning stuff from varying sources. Two of the sources that I have found very resourceful are:

* FullStackPyyhon
* RealPython

<br/>
To complement what I learn on fullstackpython, I have subscribed to the "Talk Python to Me" podcast, which is run by the same author.

There are a number of other resources I have come across, which I have listed below this post.

# Slack is Tweak-friendly

> How I migrated the locked default channel on Slack.

[Slack](http://slack.com) is a communication platform built for teams. While it is free by default, there are features reserved for paid users. However, the free version already comes with a ton of cool features, and is highly usable as is, especially for teams that are relatively small. My team has stuck with this unpaid version of the application for a few months.

Recently, we decided to have our clients join our Slack team, with some envisaged benefits:

* It would ease the process of keeping the client up-to-date on project progress
* It would bring our clients to our preferred communication platform, bringing them all in one place
* We could leverage some of the many tools available for use with Slack to improve our communication with clients. It's worth noting that Slack is very API friendly.

<br/>
In doing this, we were presented with a small challenge. All of our previous conversations which had mostly being in the public, general channel, **_#general_**, were now open to our newly signed-on client. Some of these conversations obviously included stuff we would rather be more privy about. This meant I had to quickly find a way to _migrate_ -- I chose not to _delete_ -- the messages in the hope that he had not scrolled back through the channel's message log.


This would have been easier if Slack allowed certain modifications to the default channel named _#general_<sup>__[1]__</sup>. For instance, Slack prevents the deletion of this channel. On top of that, Slack puts some restrictions on private channels:

* They can't be [deleted, but can be _archived_](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185307-Deleting-a-channel).
* They can't be changed to _public_ channels even though the reverse is possible.

<br/>
These limitations notwithstanding, the following explains my approach to tackling the problem.

First I used Slack's [export](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Exporting-your-team-s-Slack-history) feature to backup all of our conversations, including channel information. A caveat here is, _Slack does not include private channels' data with exported data by default_<sup>__[2]__</sup>, but thankfully, we hadn't any private rooms at the time.

Now, Slack exports team data in JSON format, making it very easy to work with. Having downloaded the exported data, I started looking through it for parts that I could tweak.

There were some top-level (__root folder__) files which included meta-data about users, teams and channels. Then there were also folders for each channel, in which, conversation logs were kept, grouped by days.

Next, I edited the `channels.json` file in the top-level directory, and changed the name of the channel _#general_, which contained the messages, to some new name. Then I went and renamed the folder named `general`, to this new name.

With these changes in place, I compressed the modified files alongside the unmodified ones into a _zip_ archive; the original Slack-exported data had come in a zip file as well. Slack allows you to [import](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201748703-Importing-message-history) this zip file into your Slack team, which was what I did next.

During the import, Slack automatically tried to match detected channels (from the import) with existing ones, after-which I was presented with a page that displayed the mapping suggestions. I simply set it not to map but create new channels instead.

Upon successful completion of the imports, I went on to delete all the messages in the existing _#general_ channel. Those messages were now the contents of a newly minted channel, created using the new name I previously gave to it.

With all these in place, I did two more things:

* I edited and marked the new channel as _private_, and
* I welcomed our new client to our Slack space __;) __

# A Peek into Blueprints in Flask

I know there are many useful tutorials that explain the concept of Blueprints in Flask, but I have decided to enlist another to the [sub for 'long list' avalanche] of resources already available.


##First, why Blueprints?

The Flask documentation says [somethings]() about Blueprints and why they are useful. I would like to highlight on one point from that page:

> Provide template filters, static files, templates, and other utilities through blueprints. A blueprint does not have to implement applications or view functions.


Blueprints give a straightforward way to think of how to structure your application using modules, although you are not limited to blueprint modules alone; your app may  contain other modules as you wish.

I started looking for common patterns among blueprints, and I discovered that, a blueprint can have among other things it's own set of view functions, with an optional URL prefix (configured using the `url_prefix` parameter in the instantiation of a new Blueprint object).


An easy way to illustrate this is with the exanple of a web application that has different levels of users: regular users, moderators and administrators.

Let's say you wish to implement the login processes for these levels differently, and present them with different pages (UI-wise), and at different URLs.

You

wGetting Them All!


If you are in a location with internet connection issues, or limited by the amount of bandwidth you can afford, then there are ways you can leverage the resources that are useful to you on the web.

Some websites or blogs have content arranged in order of chapters that I like to read in that order. And some others just appeal to me as troves of useful content that I would want to keep within easy reach. The challenge with this is that there are times when I have no active internet subcscription or connection, making such resources unavailable to me.

Interestingly, it is possible for me to keep an entire website offline. With the help of some of tools, I could download the site for offline reading! This is **particularly workable with static sites** that have no interaction with the backend, other than delivering static pages to us -- so don't think of doing this with Facebook, or Quora. **:)**

<br/>

There are two ways I do this:

1. I use the __[HTTrack Website Copier](http://www.httrack.com/)__ software, which is available cross platform; and 
2. __[wget](http://linux.die.net/man/1/wget)__, I learnt about this one recently.

I also use this approach to download documentations for offline reference, since they're mostly static.

The most current version of HTTrack supports resumption of broken downloads. This is also built into wget, which is an old Linux tool.

One issue I have observed with the latter, however, is that it doesn't seem to get the CSS style files accordingly; therefore, you may have aesthetic issues with it. I have not had this problem with HTTrack.

HTTrack is multiplatform supported. There are versions for Android, Windows, and Linux, [downloadable here](http://www.httrack.com/page/2/)

The typical command for wget is:

` $ wget --continue --wait=20 --limit-rate=20K -r -p -U [BROWSER] [URL_TO_SITE]`

For example:

` $ wget --continue --wait=20 --limit-rate=20K -r -p -U Mozilla http://takwas.github.io/`

Why I write about Sports

I often like to do some rants about my favorite sports team, Arsenal FC simply because i want to prove to folks that you don't have to sit through 90 minutes to know what's going on.

I could go through an entire season of football without watching a single match, and still stay updated with what is going on.

If you don't believe me, the only I'll ask you to do is to try it out for yourself. Prior to the age of mobile apps flooding everywhere these days, I would usually get my updates by googling stuff. But that's all become much easier now, with the coming of these apps.

So why don't you try using your time on something else and watch less football.


================#####=================


Wholesome Learning !

I often tell people that I don't get much free time to watch movies, which is true. Nonetheless, I try to make the most of the few ones I get to watch.

When I watch a movie, I make sure to follow it up with some mini-research (mostly on [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org)) if it presents any interesting new piece of information; be it fact or fiction I learn all the same! Of course, not every movie gives me something to read about, but I try not to miss my after-movie review when I come across the few ones that do.

<br />

As an instance, I have recently watched the "[The Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Everything_(2014_film))" -- one of a number of movies that have been created to document the life of renowned scientist, [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking). That movie revealed a lot more about a man whom, although I have long admired, I had only skimmed the bits of his life and journey. Watching the movie brought me closer to his personality, achievements and also importantly, his [medical condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis).

<br />

This kind of learning is not your everyday classroom setting or some online tutorial; well, of course we never learn everything from the classroom! However, my point is that these movies -- the good ones -- do not only serve to entertain us, but present us knowledge alongside. Some would call this "edutainment". It is indirect learning, but I can tell you for certain that this is one way I've picked up knowledge of many things I would ordinarily not seek for.

What's more? Movie production crews are very mindful of their usage of time, so they tend to cramp it all to fit within the conventional 1-2 hour duration of screen time, hiding some details in the process. This is especially evident with movies that are book-based.

But it's not all movies. There are of course, other sources I learn from.

While I have not really taking any writing course despite my yearnings for qualitative writing, I have over time continued to gauge the quality of my writings both with the help of some kind reviewers and through self review, I am always glad to hear positive comments; and I make certain to improve on the negative ones.

But most importantly, I learn and improve -- almost passively -- from simply taking in other people's works. When I scour the net for information or read blog posts or articles, I am not just getting what I need at that moment, but I am also taking in, albeit subconsciously, the presentation style of the document.

For example, one of such rich places, content wise, is [Quora](http://quora.com). The _top writers_ (people who often give good answers to questions and get frequent _upvotes_ from other members of the Quora community) are often very articulate and neat in their prose. So somehow, again subconsciously, I have been taking cues from those.

Also, when you chat, try to avoid the use of SMS language. In my opinion, it negatively affects your writing. Sometimes I'd unconsciously use "pls" instead of "please" while writing formally. Also, I use chats as playground for practicing good sentence constructions. So, I don't abbreviate unnecessarily, and I try to use punctuations appropriately. I advise you do same.

As a side note, I find that even though my writing is not exactly top-notch, when I re-read stuff I have written ten days later, I am usually quite impressed and can make improvements. So as a word of advice, "do not despise the days of your little beginnings." Just do it.

<br />

I also take time to listen to talks (especially [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)) and podcasts. Whether it be commuting time, or time I'm doing some laundry, I try to maximise my use of time; __who says multitasking is a myth__?

In fact, in [crowdsourcing for academic paper suggestions](/i-am-reading-papers), one of the folks who answered [my question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-recommended-list-of-essays-papers-to-read-one-per-day-in-2016-for-an-autodidact-who-wants-to-widen-his-horizon?share=1) suggested I read transcripts of TED talks. It wouldn't come as a surprise to anyone conversant with these talks that they are so rich and insightful. They bring to you a wide array of perspectives from different minds across the globe. Bottom line is, whether you agree with their postulations or not, you learn!

<br/>

If you'll keep these points in mind as you explore life, you'll find that there are lots of activities that can educate you and give you pleasure at the same time. Try to learn from all of your day-to-day activities and life experiences. So if an activity doesn't _somehow_ benefit you whilst eating into your time, _do your hardest_ to abstain from it.

<br/>

Some tips for getting better at English usage:

+ Read __widely__; cross-genre reading
+ Play word games (crosswords, scrabble, ...)
+ Watch (and listen to) English speakers **with intent**
+ Make the dictionary, thesaurus and any other similar lookup book (e.g. references for idioms, phrasal verbs) your friends
+ Participate in online English communities. An example is the ##English channel on [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/python)
+ Write consciously, and often
+ Speak English **confidently**

Today is the last day in 2015.

I went to church to attend the sixth in a 7-day series prayer programme that climaxes in the new year -- first day of the new year.

After church today, I went to Computer Village at Ikeja to purchase for the wife of my pastor -- Pastor C.O Odusina. This was a follow to a similar purchase for his son only two days ago.

Well, I got the phone and a couple of accessories, but the interesting twist to the journey was the girl "Luby Asaa" whom I met at the store. She striked me as having a strong psychological twist to her character. I also met her sister who impressed me with her show of dexterity in hand-cutting a smartphone screen protector.

On my way home from the market, I purchased a new book on Hitler - taDa! -  titled, " ... "

I got back home at noon and spent well over two setting up the new device and some other phones at my pastors'. He had visitors while I was there to whom  he almost didn't pay much attention in their over-thirty minutes visit. It was woman with her four children, the eldest just fresh outta college. The children had some interesting rhyming scheme to their names; they all ended with "mide": Ayomide, Aramide; Olamide and Iremide.


On a different and rather sad note, I learnt just this evening about the death of Ian Murdock -- founder of the Debian Linux distro, and the "ian" in "Debian". At the time of this writing, details about the cause of his death have yet to be disclosed. However, his tweets in recent days point mention suicide and police brutatlity.

I've spent the last hour reading and learning about IRC. I intend to write my own bot that lives on IRC, and hopefully evolves to provide some unique features.

I learnt particularly about the _Twisted_ Python library, which is quite dated. It was even interesting to learn that the `logging` module that comes with `twisted` pre-dated that in the Python `std-lib`.

I am writing this with only a few hours for this year to end. I'll be in church very soon, and it won't be until 2016 before I resume any writing or coding.

Small Bug with Pelican

In the evening, I was able to fix a small bug with my blog that was caused by conflicting options. When I created the "Life Log" category and added a first post in that category, I also added the tag "life log". Both of these were resolved by Pelican as "life-log".

Usually, when you add a new category or tag to your blog post, depending on your configuration, it would most likely be the case that new templates for feed generation would be added. For instance, if I added a new a tag on my blog named `"some_tag"`, my blog would try to generate a `some_tag.` Now tags and categories would generate feed and these resulted in some sort of conflict because they would generate the same files for feeds. It was such a subtle bug, I had no clue what was going at first, and couldn't get help on IRC either. Eventually, I asked on IRC how I could run Pelican with debugging enabled, and flobin (an IRC user on the #pelican channel) came to my rescue with: `pelican ... --debug`. This was what I needed.

On using the `--debug` swith with the `pelican` command, I got a full traceback,which had previously been suppressed without

#I am reading papers!

If I had a resolution for the new year, it would be my plan to read one academic paper per day. I feel as though reading people's documented research work would help broaden my knowledge and deepen my insight.

So I started looking for a way to crowdsource paper suggestions from a source, namely Quora. However, as I didn't get the much needed feedback in due time, Google was my next available buddy. I did land on [this page on Github](paperswelove)

After launching the first paper in my document reader software, I was surprised to see that my earlier projections of papers being under 20 pages was flawed, and so I decided to replan the whole paper-reading thing.

Therefore, I will now attempt to read at least one paper per week.

The reasons for this are not far fetched. I don't want to consume these publications like some fictional works. Instead, I want to read to near-full if not full understanding of their content.

The paper I am currently reading, my first, is "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" by __Roy Thomas Fielding__. It was his submission for a doctoral program in the year 2000.

I'm thinking now about the troubles I had with my stomach in 2015, and I think the idea of "routine fasts" should stop or be minimised.

I got good commendations from Catherine Oates and Michelle Gaugy -- both Quora acquaintances -- about the improvement in my writing ability. That's some encouragement for some more commitment and consistency in writing in 2016.

"We won't waste your time," the one lie I have heard over and again. It is true that time spent in God's house is never wasted ...

Church is always fun.

The feeling you get when you are in that atmosphere, where everyone tries to look their best, both in clothing and in attitude. Sometimes I wonder if all these people I see in church never commit any sin. Looking at my life though, I know better.

TESTS THAT FAILED TO RUN


Later, I got to my computer and began to find a fix for a bug I encountered while trying to setup testing for the IRC bot project I am contributing to. The script to run the tests had continously failed to run.

So I got on IRC, posted my question+code and started seeking the angel to get me out of my misery. While reading a blog post -- one of the few I wandered to -- I came across a comment that said something like,

"Look at the code in your site-packages to learn the ropes."

That was it! Oh, but that only led to a makeshift solution.

With my sublime code editor, I quickly navigated to the site-packages folder for my Python virtual environment. I looked for those folders containing "tests", looked through some of their code, and the only helpful one I could find at the time was the "simplejson" library.

Right there the main file that ran the tests was the following code:

…

I copied this code used it with my code, and voila, my tests ran successfully by failing. Alas, this was the beginning of another inquest. I wanted to know why that snippet of code worked.

So I got back to IRC, made all the noise I could, asking questions, pastebinning snippets of my code. But I didn't get the response I was looking for. Eventually, user 'Wooble' made a statement that made the most sense:

> " You don't run a script…   "

Sublime has `find_under_expand` (Ctrl+D)

This is a very useful tool for refactoring. A more interesting way to find and replace.

I use it to locate text with similar characters, or with some minimal regexp matching, text with similar structuring.

Ctrl+[RIGHT_ARROW] - Go to end of word
Ctrl+[LEFT_ARROW] - Go to beginning of word

END - Go to end of line
HOME - Go to beginning of line

Ctrl+Shift+D - Duplicate line

"To be the worst person in the room could be a blessing."

It "could" be a blessing if the concept is not mistaken with inferiority complex.

Personally, this is one bit of truth I had -- until now -- intentionally swept under the carpet. You could be in the wrong room if you're getting all the praises and failing to be sensitive to same.

When you find yourself looking down on those around you, it's probably time to switch rooms. Finding the right room is finding the room in which you're the worst. Being in the wrong room hinders growth. Being the worst person in the room motivates you to grow.

Sitting atop could keep your gaze at the bottom. While those down below might have high aspirations, you  mightn't feel the need to get to something higher than you, easily lending yourself to complacency.

This does not however mean that it's wrong to be in the top seat. If this is the case with you, this may be clichéd, but one of the things you'd need for survival is humility.



If you're like me, you'll find that it's a bitter pill to swallow discovering someone is better than you; even failure is. I spent last year advocating the "fail fast, fail frequently" rule. Now I realise that talk is cheap.
================#####=================

Sitting in this bus, and I just noticed something I consider unusual. An elderly (quited aged) couple in front of me: a Christian wife and a Muslim husband, both observing their "rituals", well, so adorably.

At first I imagined talking the man into Christianity so that their togetherness wouldn't terminate here on earth. That may only be halfway correct as I recall the Bible mentions "there will be no marriages in heaven". A family ties end here on earth.

Realigning My Reading and Writing Goals


I had made this resolution to read academic papers, daily. I had yet another to log ny life daily. The latter was only successful for the first few days of the year.

Now in accordance with what reality presents me, I will change both schedules.

Read one academic paper per month and only log weekly, cutting out unnecessary details.

I will still continue to maintain [open sourced logs on Github](), but won't post much of it; only weekly summarised and refined content will make it here.

Asking the Right Questions on Quora

Quora has a policy that encourages users to ask "any kind" of questions.

While I understand that they need to generate traffic by welcoming people's queries in whatever forms, I beg to disagree with this approach.

Sometimes I have a question in mind, and Quora being, for me,  the de facto Q&A portal, comes to mind. However, I get to ask only few of those.

As an example, this morning I pondered on the name of the arguably number one app for learning foreign languages "Duolingo".  I thought to ask what language that word was coined from, but then I thought better of it. What is Google for? 
Asking every question on Quora, in my opinion, renders content from other parts of the web "useless".

Continuing with the example I cited above, the better question to ask would be, "Did the authors of the Duolingo app consciously name the app using the Latin language?"

Futthermore, the Quora approach kills research.

When you ask questions, you learn more than what you seek . This is often the case with me. I ho searching for 'A' then I a learn about B and C anf D and possibly more.

This is how the learning chain -- or should i say tree -- works. The learning nodes lead one to another. I should maybe even use the term "web".

Becoming the Social Programmer

Well, thanks to my friend, Aniekan, I decided to peek outside my usual niche to see what's happening in other parts of the planet.

Last Sunday, I set out on a search for the developer programs available in Beau, Cameroon. This definitely didn't end up as a futile mission.

The first group I found was the Google Developer Group in Beau run by [name here]. Next was the PlaywithPython initiative. And my last stop was… This one led me to Ubuntu  Africa, the Ubuntu community that encompasses all African Linux and Ubuntu users.

Making the leap

You know you don't have to be a programmer to be cool, right?

If you're convinced that programming.os the way forward for you, then let me hold you through your journey just for a moment.

I have seen lots of developers…..

Do you like to solve problems?
Do you run from or face your challenges?
Are you careful to manage resources effectively?
Do you like digging into details?
Are you intuitive?

On the Stellar Train!

Two days ago, I attended Stellar.org's fireside chat at [Idea Hub]() in Lagos. It was an enlightening event; one that may well be my gateway into the world of open source in the year.

No doubt this will present a somewhat steep learning curve knowing that my background in finance (and [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology)) is not much to write home about. The experience and payoffs will of course be worth the while and I am expecting more developers to join the train as the platform is still very welcoming at this point.

Stellar is a fairly new financial technology service that aims to be the de facto way in which we move money around.

From Stellar's FAQ page,

> "Stellar is a decentralized protocol you can use to send and receive money in any pair of currencies. So for example, the protocol supports sending money in dollars and having it arrive in pesos."

<br/>

I particularly like the analogy used [here](https://techpoint.ng/2016/01/28/how-stellar-kickstart-nigeria-payments-revolution/) by the Executive Director of Stellar, Joyce Kim,

> "The Stellar platform functions a lot like email whose underlying protocol is SMTP. Before SMTP, you could only email people that were in the same company, network or ISP as you"

<br/>
She says it would be a lot like being able to send mails across different mail providers.

Most of the details of the workings of Stellar are still very unclear to me, but a few things I've been able to make sense of include:

+ Stellar operates on a decentralized network of servers

+ Stellar maintains an open digital ledger of transactions. This data is synchronized on all servers.

+ Financial institutions subscribed to the Stellar service (called gateways, and to act as "trust" houses) can offer Stellar credits.

+ Stellar credits are used to resolve currency pairing issues.

+ A Consensus is how Stellar verifies the credibility of a transaction before allowing it to pull through.

Stellar.org provides an _[explain](https://www.stellar.org/learn/explainers/)_ page to describe these concepts. However, I find [this article](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/01/stellar-open-source-solution-international-money-transfers-currency/) very explanatory.

<br/>

I have joined Stellar's public [Slack team](http://stellar-public.slack.com). And so far, I've been received with warm arms. I encourage many budding programmers looking to get their feet wet with open source projects to join this platform and make some contributions. The mantra for me is "even if it fails..." I think this says enough already.

At the moment, the project I'm looking to contribute to is the [Python library](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base) for interfacing with the [Stellar core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).

This project is still in beta form and could readily use some help. It was suggested to me by Scott Fleckenstein ([@nullstyle](https://twitter.com/nullstyle)), the first Engineer at Stellar. At the event, Scott tried to work us through the technical nitty-gritties: innerworkings, stack and how-to-get-started with contributing to the Stellar project. 

These are just some of the things I have been able to wrap my mind around thus far. I am optimistic that once I tie myself in the loop of working on the code and working with the leads I get from time to time, it would all clear out in due course.

UBUNTU AFRIK



####For starters, the meeting's raw logs are available [here](http://52.17.74.45/freenode-%23ubuntu-africa/2016-01-27-18-31-20.html).

Because I know that reading logs like that might not be the most enjoyable task for your eyes, I have tried to make this blog post a more pleasant-for-the-eyes version of it. :)

The [Ubuntu Africa user community](http://ubuntu-africa.info/) had a meeting on IRC on Wednesday, 26 January 2013 -- a meeting of Linux and Ubuntu users in Africa. It's a call for more African "nuxers"<sup>__[1]__</sup> to join in growing the community.

We believe that coming together to work together will bring about a more rapid growth. Owing to our disparate skills individually, we need communities like this that will present us with people who are skilled in the areas that we are lacking.

Looking through the [directory of Ubuntu LoCos](http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/), I find it a little surprising that there are no efforts for an active community in my home country, Nigeria. Many people I have met scarcely even know about [IRC](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat) around here. More so with the coming of [Slack](http://slack.com).

My recent foray into the African developer community had informed me about this event a few days earlier.

Minutes before the meeting, some users (myself inclusive) had arrived the IRC channel and engaged in discussions while patiently waiting for the scheduled meeting time.

The meeting began at the set time. And it was, as it was customary, chaired by a user whom had been elected in the last meeting Naeil Zoueidi (@Na3iL)<sup>__[2]__</sup> from Tunisia. The other person who seemed to have some good footing in the house was Miles Sharp (@Kilos)<sup>__[2]__</sup> from South Africa.

Attendees at the meeting came from different African nations including Cameroon (with the highest population and mostly first-timers), Tunisia, South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, RDC and Nigeria.

The primary language used during discussion was English. However, Kilos pointed out that if any user struggled with the English language, they could use their own language (most likely French) in the hope that someone would translate for them.

<br/>
The [#ubuntu-africa](irc://freenode.net/ubuntu-africa) channel has a bot called __QA__ that logs meetings and does a few other tasks. At the beginning of meetings attending users are expected to introduce themselves using the format:

    QA: I am [first name] [last name] - [country]

OR

    QA: I am [first name] [last name] from [country]

When a user does this correctly, the bot would respond to the user confirming receipt of the information. This is doable anytime during the meeting. So if a user comes in late, that's the first thing he'd be expected to do.

I have noticed that the bot performs no parsing whatsoever on this given data and just logs it as is. Therefore, it's in a user's best interest to adhere (strictly) to the format given above.

<br/>
Before the meeting, there had been an [agenda page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AfricanTeams/Meetings/20160127) -- I believe this was open for suggestions on the [mailing list](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-africa) -- for the issues to be discussed at the meeting. And this was strictly followed during the meeting.

<br/>

#####The following is my excerpt from the meeting:

The Ubuntu Africa community is currently an unofficial group. It would need more activity to gain the official recognition. Therefore, we have a mandate to try and convince users from all local Linux User Groups to join the Ubuntu Africa community whilst still being active in their respective communities, as this community is country agnostic and aims to bring us all under one umbrella.

Users were encouraged to get word out about the fledgling community through their social hangouts (Facebook, Twitter and the rest...). More suggestions came in on how to  get the publicizing done. Users suggested YouTube videos, Twitter posts ([#ubuntu-africa](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ubuntuAfrica?src=hash)) and blog posts (like the one you are reading now).

The agreement was that Pieter Engelbrecht (@chesedo) from South Africa would put up the blog post. And just in case you want to help get the word out too, here's the link to share: http://ubuntu-africa.info

<br/>

The chair of the meeting raised a point about making some improvements to the [current website of the community](http://ubuntu-africa.info) -- adding a blog section to it. This brought our attention to the designer of the current portal, Raoul Snyman (@superfly) from South Africa and due thanks were accorded by users.

@superfly revealed that the current site was implemented using the static blog generator, _Nikola_, meaning it already comes with a blogging feature, although it hadn't yet been activated, since no one had been available to blog on the site. @Na3iL offered to help with the blogging, and in the end it was agreed that the task would be handled collaboratively by @superfly (technically) and @Na3iL (literarily).

Stephen Mawutor Donkor from Ghana (@mawutor) made one final suggestion in this regard about getting involved in Ubuntu-Lab projects for schools as a way to gain some media attention.. His suggestion was commended.

<br/>

Now to something more technical. Another memeber of the group Cameroonian member @ongolaBoy talked about the issues surrounding approval of our mirror. He stated that the status of submission had gone from "pending" to "Unofficial", which is a good thing.

He shared the URL to the Launchpad page of the mirror: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/miroir.cm.auf.org-archive

Everyone was impressed with this news.

<br />

The last topic tended toward "social" again, and it was kick-started by the chair with the question, "Any new coming events?"

Kilos mentioned the upcoming release of Ubuntu 16.04, which we all anticipate for April. The Tunisian folks (@Na3iL and @elacheche_anis) got talking about some SysAdmin workshop still in the works.

@Na3iL then made the suggestion for an Ubucon. "Why don't we plan for an Ubuncon?" He asked. He followed that nicely enough with definition of the term Ubucon:

> "An Ubucon is generally an informal, lightly structured gathering of Ubunteros. There are also other meetings and UbuntuConferences"

<br/>

At this juncture, things were beginning to wound up as the chairperson of the meeting, @Na3iL moved the motion for "Elect chairperson for next meeting". This was about the quickest thing to be concluded as there was an immediate unanimous re-election of @Na3iL.

The final motion for the day was for the selection of a date for the next meeting. Someone suggested that this be treated in the [mailing list](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-africa) as a way to get people to use the list. Thus, everyone agreed that the date for next meeting be decided in there.

I think the name of the user who came in at this time deserves a mention. It was @d3r1ck -- we didn't get his full identity.
