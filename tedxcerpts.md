Excerpts from TED(x) Talks
==========================

The Minimalists
---------------



James Altucher - "Choose Yourself"
----------------------------------

Don't complain. Find ways to turn complain opportunities to gratitude opportunities
Don't fail fast. Experiment.



Zain Asher - "Trust Your Struggle" (TEDx Euston)
------------------------------------------------

Don't compete. Create.
Don't give just to receive; but know that you receive when you give.
Success comes when opportunity meets preparation
Your opportunity will one day come. You just have to be ready.
